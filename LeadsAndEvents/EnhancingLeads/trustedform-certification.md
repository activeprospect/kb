<script type="text/javascript">
    (function() {
        var tf = document.createElement('script');
        tf.type = 'text/javascript';
        tf.async = true;
        tf.src = '//api.trustedform.com/trustedform.js?field=cert_id&ping_field=ping_id';
        var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
        s.parentNode.insertBefore(tf, s);
    })();
</script>
```

**Hidden Form Fields:**
```html
Required Hidden Fields:
<input type="hidden" name="cert_id" id="cert_id" />
<input type="hidden" name="ping_id" id="ping_id" />
```

**Configuration Options:**
- Custom field names for certificate and ping IDs
- Multi-page form support and tracking
- Custom consent language and disclosure
- Advanced tracking and analytics options

### Certificate Generation Process

**Form Interaction Tracking:**
1. **Page Load** - TrustedForm begins tracking user interaction
2. **Form Engagement** - Records user typing, clicking, and scrolling
3. **Consent Capture** - Documents consent language and user agreement
4. **Form Submission** - Generates certificate upon form completion
5. **Certificate Storage** - Securely stores certificate and interaction data

**Certificate Components:**
```
TrustedForm Certificate Contents:
├── Unique Certificate ID: Permanent identifier
├── Form Snapshot: Complete form HTML capture
├── Consent Language: Exact consent text displayed
├── User Interaction: Typing, clicking, scrolling data
├── Browser Information: User agent, IP address
├── Timestamps: Complete interaction timeline
├── Geographic Data: Location information
└── Security Hash: Tamper-proof verification
```
