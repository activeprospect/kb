# Automated Retry

Automated retry in LeadConduit ensures reliable lead delivery by intelligently handling temporary failures and network issues. This system maintains delivery success rates while protecting recipient systems from excessive retry attempts and optimizing overall flow performance.

## Retry System Overview

### Purpose of Automated Retry

**Reliability Enhancement:**
- Overcome temporary network connectivity issues
- Handle recipient system downtime and maintenance windows
- Manage API rate limiting and throttling conditions
- Ensure lead delivery despite transient failures

**Performance Optimization:**
- Reduce manual intervention requirements
- Maintain high delivery success rates automatically
- Optimize retry timing to avoid system overload
- Balance delivery speed with system stability

**Business Continuity:**
- Prevent lead loss due to temporary technical issues
- Maintain partner satisfaction through reliable delivery
- Reduce support burden from delivery failures
- Ensure consistent revenue flow and operations

### When Retry Logic Activates

**Temporary Error Conditions:**
- Network timeouts and connectivity issues
- HTTP 5xx server errors from recipient systems
- Rate limiting responses (HTTP 429)
- Temporary authentication failures
- DNS resolution failures

**Retry Trigger Examples:**
```
Retry Conditions:
├── HTTP 500 Internal Server Error
├── HTTP 502 Bad Gateway
├── HTTP 503 Service Unavailable
├── HTTP 504 Gateway Timeout
├── HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
├── Connection timeout errors
├── DNS resolution failures
└── Network connectivity issues
```

## Retry Configuration

### Global Retry Settings

**System-Level Configuration:**
- Default retry attempts (typically 3-5 retries)
- Base retry interval timing
- Maximum retry duration limits
- Exponential backoff multipliers

**Account-Level Customization:**
- Override default retry behavior
- Set account-specific retry limits
- Configure custom retry intervals
- Define failure escalation procedures

### Step-Level Retry Configuration

**Individual Step Settings:**
- Override global retry configuration per step
- Set step-specific retry attempts
- Configure custom retry intervals for specific integrations
- Define step-specific failure handling

**Configuration Options:**
```
Step Retry Configuration:
├── Retry attempts: 1-10 (default: 3)
├── Initial retry delay: 1-60 seconds (default: 2)
├── Backoff multiplier: 1.5-3.0 (default: 2.0)
├── Maximum retry interval: 1-300 seconds (default: 60)
├── Total retry timeout: 1-3600 seconds (default: 300)
└── Retry conditions: HTTP codes, error types
```

### Flow-Level Retry Policies

**Flow-Wide Settings:**
- Consistent retry behavior across all steps
- Integration-specific retry policies
- Partner-specific configuration requirements
- Compliance and regulatory considerations

**Policy Examples:**
```
Retry Policy Templates:
├── Conservative: 2 attempts, 5-second intervals
├── Standard: 3 attempts, exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s)
├── Aggressive: 5 attempts, exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s)
└── Custom: User-defined parameters and conditions
```

## Retry Strategies and Algorithms

### Exponential Backoff

**Standard Exponential Backoff:**
- Progressively increase delay between retry attempts
- Reduce system load during high failure periods
- Allow time for temporary issues to resolve
- Prevent overwhelming recipient systems

**Backoff Calculation:**
```
Retry Timing Example (2x multiplier):
├── Attempt 1: Immediate
├── Retry 1: 2 seconds delay
├── Retry 2: 4 seconds delay
├── Retry 3: 8 seconds delay
├── Retry 4: 16 seconds delay
└── Retry 5: 32 seconds delay (or max interval)
```

**Jitter Implementation:**
- Add randomization to retry intervals
- Prevent thundering herd problems
- Distribute retry load across time
- Improve overall system stability

### Fixed Interval Retry

**Consistent Timing:**
- Same delay between all retry attempts
- Predictable retry behavior
- Simple configuration and management
- Suitable for stable environments

**Use Cases:**
- Systems with predictable downtime patterns
- Rate-limited APIs with fixed windows
- Simple integrations without complex failure modes
- Testing and development environments

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

**Failure Detection:**
- Monitor consecutive failure rates
- Automatically disable retries after threshold
- Prevent cascading failures
- Protect downstream systems

**Circuit States:**
```
Circuit Breaker States:
├── Closed: Normal operation, retries enabled
├── Open: High failure rate, retries disabled
├── Half-Open: Testing recovery, limited retries
└── Recovery: Gradual return to normal operation
```

## Error Classification and Handling

### Retryable vs. Non-Retryable Errors

**Retryable Error Types:**
- **5xx Server Errors:** Internal server errors, bad gateway, service unavailable
- **Timeout Errors:** Connection timeouts, read timeouts, gateway timeouts
- **Rate Limiting:** Too many requests, quota exceeded
- **Network Issues:** DNS failures, connection refused, network unreachable

**Non-Retryable Error Types:**
- **4xx Client Errors:** Bad request, unauthorized, forbidden, not found
- **Authentication Failures:** Invalid credentials, expired tokens
- **Data Validation Errors:** Invalid format, missing required fields
- **Business Logic Errors:** Duplicate submission, invalid data content

### Error Response Processing

**HTTP Status Code Handling:**
```
Error Classification:
├── 400 Bad Request: Non-retryable (data/format issue)
├── 401 Unauthorized: Non-retryable (authentication issue)
├── 403 Forbidden: Non-retryable (permission issue)
├── 404 Not Found: Non-retryable (endpoint issue)
├── 429 Too Many Requests: Retryable (rate limiting)
├── 500 Internal Server Error: Retryable (temporary server issue)
├── 502 Bad Gateway: Retryable (proxy issue)
├── 503 Service Unavailable: Retryable (temporary unavailability)
└── 504 Gateway Timeout: Retryable (timeout issue)
```

**Custom Error Pattern Matching:**
- Configure retry behavior based on error message content
- Handle API-specific error codes and responses
- Implement business logic-specific retry rules
- Customize handling for integration-specific patterns

### Response Analysis and Learning

**Intelligent Error Detection:**
- Pattern recognition for recurring issues

├── Business hours: Immediate retries, faster intervals
├── Off-hours: Delayed retries, longer intervals
├── Partner maintenance windows: Suspend retries
└── Data quality issues: Limited retry attempts
```

### Multi-Channel Retry

**Channel Redundancy:**

**Retry Queue Management:**
- Priority-based retry queue processing
- Time-based retry scheduling and management
- Resource allocation for retry processing
- Capacity planning and scaling for retry operations

Automated retry systems provide the foundation for reliable lead delivery operations, ensuring business continuity while optimizing system performance and partner satisfaction. Proper configuration and monitoring enable maximum delivery success with minimal operational overhead.
