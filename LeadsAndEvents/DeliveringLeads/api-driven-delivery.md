## Field Mapping and Data Transformation

### Standard Field Mapping

**Direct Field Assignment:**
```
Field Mapping Examples:

├── lead.email → recipient.emailAddress  
├── lead.phone → recipient.primaryPhone
├── lead.state → recipient.stateCode
└── submission.timestamp → recipient.leadDate
```

**Field Type Conversion:**

- Date format transformation and timezone conversion
- Boolean value conversion (yes/no to true/false)
- Phone number formatting and normalization

### Template-Based Mapping

**Dynamic Value Generation:**
```
Template Mapping Examples:
├── Full Name: "{% raw %}{{lead.first_name}} {{lead.last_name}}{% endraw %}"
├── Lead Score: "{% raw %}{{lead.base_score + lead.quality_bonus}}{% endraw %}"
├── Campaign ID: "{% raw %}{{source.name}}_{{submission.date.format('YYYYMM')}}{% endraw %}"
└── Priority: "{% raw %}{{lead.value >= 1000 ? 'High' : 'Standard'}}{% endraw %}"
```

**Conditional Mapping:**
```
Conditional Field Assignment:
├── if lead.state == 'CA' then territory = 'West'
├── if lead.age >= 65 then segment = 'Senior'
├── if lead.income > 100000 then tier = 'Premium'
└── if source.type == 'organic' then cost = 0
```

**Advanced Template Functions:**
```
Template Function Examples:
├── Date formatting: {% raw %}{{submission.timestamp.format('MM/DD/YYYY')}}{% endraw %}
├── String manipulation: {% raw %}{{lead.email.split('@')[1]}}{% endraw %}
├── Mathematical operations: {% raw %}{{lead.monthly_income * 12}}{% endraw %}
├── Conditional logic: {% raw %}{{lead.homeowner == 'yes' ? 'Owner' : 'Renter'}}{% endraw %}
└── Data validation: {% raw %}{{lead.email.isValidEmail() ? lead.email : 'invalid'}}{% endraw %}
```

└── Custom response format validation
```

**Response Data Extraction:**

**Error Processing Logic:**
```
Error Handling Strategy:
├── Temporary errors: Retry with exponential backoff
├── Authentication errors: Alert and stop processing
├── Data validation errors: Log and continue
├── Server errors: Retry limited times, then alert
└── Timeout errors: Retry with longer timeout
```

### Retry Logic and Failure Handling
