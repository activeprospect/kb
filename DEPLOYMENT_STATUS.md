# GitHub Pages Deployment Status

## Current Status: âœ… Deployed Successfully

The site is now deployed and accessible at the following URLs:

### Main Documentation Site
- **Homepage**: https://activeprospect.github.io/kb/docs/
- **Introduction**: https://activeprospect.github.io/kb/docs/Introduction/
- **Getting Started**: https://activeprospect.github.io/kb/docs/GettingStarted/

### Root Redirect
The root URL (https://activeprospect.github.io/kb/) contains a redirect page that automatically forwards visitors to the documentation at `/kb/docs/`.

   - Fixed include syntax from `{% include 'template' %}` to `{% include template %}`
   - Marked unsupported tags (extends, block, macro) as not available in Jekyll

2. **Build Configuration**:
   - Removed baseurl override in GitHub Actions workflow
   - Fixed workflow to install dependencies from docs directory
   - Updated artifact upload path to docs/_site

3. **Redirect Setup**:
