# LeadConduit Documentation Tone Guide

This guide ensures consistency in how we write about LeadConduit. For vocabulary and terminology, see `vocabulary.md`.

## Tone Guidelines

### Be Professional Yet Accessible

**DO:** "LeadConduit processes your leads through a series of steps to ensure quality and compliance."

**DON'T:** "LeadConduit runs your leads through our awesome pipeline to make sure they're legit."

### Be Precise with Technical Terms

**DO:** "The flow uses acceptance criteria to validate leads before processing."

**DON'T:** "The workflow checks if leads are good before moving forward."

### Be Clear About Actions and Outcomes

**DO:** "When a lead fails validation, the source receives a failure response with a specific reason."

**DON'T:** "Bad leads get rejected and we tell you why."

### Be Consistent with Status Terms

Always use these exact status terms:
- **Success** - The step completed successfully
- **Failure** - The step did not complete due to validation
- **Error** - The step encountered a technical problem
- **Skip** - The step was bypassed due to criteria

### Address the User Appropriately

- Use "you" for direct instructions
- Use "the user" or "users" when describing general behavior
- Use "account holders" for customers
- Never use "clients" or "customers" when referring to LeadConduit users

## Writing Style

1. **Active Voice**: "LeadConduit validates the lead" not "The lead is validated by LeadConduit"

2. **Present Tense**: "The flow processes leads" not "The flow will process leads"

3. **Specific Numbers**: "Processes leads in 300ms" not "Processes leads quickly"

4. **Define Acronyms**: Always define on first use, even common ones

5. **Explain Impact**: Don't just describe features, explain why they matter to the user's business

## Examples of Proper Tone

**Describing a Flow:**
"A flow processes leads through a series of steps. First, it validates the lead data against your acceptance criteria. Then, it enhances the lead with additional data from integrated services. Finally, it delivers the qualified lead to your chosen recipients."

**Explaining an Integration:**
"The TrustedForm Add-On integration verifies that proper consent was obtained. It checks the TrustedForm Certificate against the lead data and retains the certificate for compliance documentation."

**Professional Yet Human:**
- "This might take a moment to process" not "Hold tight while we crunch the numbers!"
- "An error occurred during processing" not "Oops! Something went wrong!"
- "Consider using filters to improve performance" not "Pro tip: filters make things zoom!"

## The Balance

Our documentation should feel:
- **Professional** without being stiff
- **Clear** without being condescending  
- **Helpful** without being overly familiar
- **Technical** without being impenetrable
- **Confident** without being arrogant
