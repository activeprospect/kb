## Usage Guidelines

### For Copywriters

**üìö Required Reading:** Start by reading ALL documents in the root of this context folder:
1. **`vibes.md`** - The philosophical foundation (read first!)
2. **`tone.md`** - Voice guidelines and writing style
3. **`vocabulary.md`** - Official terminology and concept normalization
4. **`build.md`** - Output structure requirements
5. **`setup.md`** - Technical setup information

**Then proceed with:**
5. **Always use the v2 outline** located in `outlines/v2/`
6. Follow `docs/getting-started.md` for practical implementation steps

### Version Control
- The `outlines/` directory preserves our iteration history
- v1 is kept for reference but should not be used for new work
- v2 represents our current best practices and structure

## Key Principles
- **Philosophy First:** Start with `vibes.md` to understand the spirit
- **Consistency Matters:** Use `tone.md` and `vocabulary.md` religiously
- **Structure is Critical:** Follow the v2 outline exactly
- **Quality Over Speed:** Better to write less content that truly helps users

Remember: These guidelines exist to ensure every piece of documentation delivers a delightful, helpful experience to LeadConduit users.
