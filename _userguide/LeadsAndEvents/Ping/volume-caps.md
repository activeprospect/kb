# Volume Caps (Rule-Based)

Volume caps in LeadConduit's ping system provide essential cost control and quality management by automatically limiting lead acquisition based on sophisticated rule-based criteria. These intelligent volume controls protect budget, maintain service quality, and optimize resource allocation.

## Time-Based Volume Caps

### Hourly Volume Controls

**Real-Time Flow Management:**
```
Hourly Cap Configuration:
├── Basic Hourly Limits:
│   ├── Business Hours (9 AM - 6 PM): 100 leads/hour
│   ├── Extended Hours (6 PM - 9 PM): 75 leads/hour
│   ├── Evening Hours (9 PM - 12 AM): 50 leads/hour
│   └── Off Hours (12 AM - 9 AM): 25 leads/hour
├── Dynamic Hourly Adjustments:
│   ├── High Performance Hours: +25% volume increase
│   ├── Standard Performance: Baseline volume
│   ├── Low Performance Hours: -25% volume decrease
│   └── Problem Hours: Volume suspension
├── Geographic Time Zones:
│   ├── East Coast (EST): Primary business hours
│   ├── Central (CST): Adjusted hour calculations
│   ├── Mountain (MST): Regional optimization
│   ├── West Coast (PST): Extended hours coverage
│   └── Multiple Zones: Aggregated hour management
└── Emergency Controls:
    ├── Budget Alert (80% consumed): Reduce to 50% rate
    ├── Budget Warning (90% consumed): Reduce to 25% rate
    ├── Budget Critical (95% consumed): Emergency suspension
    └── Manual Override: Administrative control
```

**Implementation Logic:**
```
Hourly Cap Rules:
├── Standard Hourly Rule:
│   ├── Condition: current_hour_volume < hourly_limit
│   ├── Action: Accept ping for bidding
│   ├── Alternative: current_hour_volume >= hourly_limit
│   └── Action: Reject ping (volume cap reached)
├── Quality-Adjusted Hourly Rule:
│   ├── Condition: (current_hour_volume < hourly_limit) || 
│   │             (lead_score >= 8.5 && premium_hour_volume < premium_limit)
│   ├── Action: Accept high-quality leads beyond standard limit
│   ├── Rationale: Quality exception handling
│   └── Monitoring: Premium volume tracking
├── Time-Weighted Hourly Rule:
│   ├── Condition: weighted_hourly_consumption < adjusted_limit
│   ├── Calculation: time_remaining_in_hour * average_consumption_rate
│   ├── Purpose: Smooth distribution across hour
│   └── Benefit: Avoid hour-end volume spikes
└── Rollover Hourly Rule:
    ├── Condition: unused_previous_hour_capacity > 0
    ├── Action: current_limit += (unused_capacity * rollover_percentage)
    ├── Maximum: current_limit <= (base_limit * max_rollover_multiplier)
    └── Reset: Daily rollover capacity reset
```
