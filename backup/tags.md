## Tag Usage Guidelines

### Multiple Tags
Most content should have 3-7 tags from different categories:
- 1 user role tag (primary audience)
- 1 experience level tag
- 1-2 content type tags
- 1-2 feature area tags and/or model concept tags
- 1-2 use case tags
- Additional tags as relevant

### Tag Combinations
Common effective combinations:
- `buyer-focused` + `beginner` + `how-to` + `vendor-management`
- `advanced` + `best-practices` + `performance-optimization`
- `troubleshooting` + `analytics` + `semi-technical`
- `conceptual` + `types-focused` + `data-management` + `intermediate`
- `reference` + `rules-focused` + `business-logic` + `universal`

### Avoid Over-Tagging
Don't use conflicting tags:
- Not both `beginner` and `advanced`
- Not both `technical` and `non-technical`
- Not all industry tags - use `universal` instead

### Regular Review
Tags should be reviewed quarterly to:
- Add new tags for emerging patterns
- Deprecate unused tags
- Refine definitions based on usage
- Ensure consistent application
