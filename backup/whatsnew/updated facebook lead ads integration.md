### Updated Facebook Lead Ads integration

We're pleased to announce a significant update to LeadConduit's Facebook Lead Ads integration. You can connect Facebook Pages directly to any LeadConduit flow. All the standard Facebook fields are automatically connected to your flow and all you have to do to complete the set up is add field mappings for custom Facebook Form Fields.

In addition, you can easily claim TrustedForm Facebook Lead Ads certificates using the Trustedform integration in the same flow!

[See the Facebook Lead Ads KB for more details](https://support.activeprospect.com/hc/en-us/articles/208248126)
