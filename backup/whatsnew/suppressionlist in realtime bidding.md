### SuppressionList in Real-time Bidding

## We have introduced a new capability: using SuppressionList queries in acceptance criteria and pricing to give greater control over your Real-time Bidding!    This addition to Real-time Bidding allows you to leverage SuppressionList to make decisions about whether you want to accept a lead, or change your bid on a lead.     Adding SuppressionList to be used within Acceptance Criteria, Volume Caps and Pricing will allow you to…    \- Reject leads earlier in the process, providing better, more instantaneous feedback to Sellers while minimizing spend on processing leads you don’t want     \- Protect yourself from litigation by not bidding on leads that have already asked to not be contacted    \- Bid more aggressively on leads you perceive to be of higher value    \- Bid less aggressively on leads you perceive to be of lower value    Your account must be enabled for Real-time Bidding and using SuppressionList to use this feature on the Ping.
