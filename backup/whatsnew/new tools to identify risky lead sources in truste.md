### New Tools to Identify Risky Lead Sources in TrustedForm

We‚Äôve launched new updates in our TrustedForm app to help you identify leads from unverified domains, a key risk for compliance and lead quality. In the Home tab, you‚Äôll now see three new charts showing the breakdown of retained certificates across confirmed vs. unconfirmed domains, the percentage of unverified sources, and a vendor list.

In the Retain tab, any new certificates from unverified domains will now include a clear warning icon. These updates apply only to new certificates moving forward.

**Why This Matters**
Buying leads from anonymous sources puts your business at serious risk. If a lead generator hasn‚Äôt confirmed domain ownership, they can‚Äôt be held accountable, and that opens the door to regulatory violations, fraud, and low-quality leads.

![‚úÖ](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/2705.png)**Compliance:** When domain ownership is confirmed, we can alert sources about potential TCPA issues and help all parties stay compliant.
![üõ°](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/1f6e1.png)Ô∏è **Fraud prevention:** Bad actors hide behind anonymity. If a domain isn‚Äôt verified, you have no way of knowing who‚Äôs behind the lead.
![üîé](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/1f50e.png)**Trust:** Your legal and compliance teams need transparency. If a vendor can‚Äôt (or won‚Äôt) confirm their domains, it raises serious concerns about credibility.

**What You Should Do Now** If you're buying leads from unconfirmed domains, it‚Äôs time to act. Ask your vendors to confirm all domains used to generate your leads in ActiveProspect. This process gives you the transparency needed to protect your business.

We‚Äôve created a vendor outreach email template to make it easy to get started.
