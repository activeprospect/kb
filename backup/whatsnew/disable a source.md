### Disable a Source

Now you can temporarily prevent a source from submitting leads into your flow by disabling that source within LeadConduit.

Leads sent from a disabled source never enter your flow and don’t incur a transaction cost, so it’s a helpful way to manage unexpected situations with your lead sellers or web forms.

To get started, navigate to the source tab within your flow editor and disable the source by clicking the ellipsis on the right and selecting the **disable source** option. Follow the same steps to enable your source.
