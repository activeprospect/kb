### Enhanced Session Replay: Now Available to All Customers!

We’re thrilled to announce that our enhanced session replay is now available to all customers! Previously exclusive to accounts using our latest product offerings, these powerful new features are now accessible across the board, giving you even more control and insights into user interactions.

**Key Enhancements Include:**

- **Hover Over Events**: See what happened at any point in the timeline with just a hover.
- **Click to Jump Ahead**: Click on any event or spot on the timeline to jump directly to that moment.
- **Previous/Next Event Navigation**: Easily navigate through interactions with the previous and next event buttons.
- **Skip Inactivity**: Enable the “Skip Inactivity” feature to breeze through periods of inactivity and focus on key moments.
- **Replay from the Start**: Start the session replay from the beginning and watch it as many times as needed.
- **Event Log Navigation**: Jump to specific moments directly from the event log.
- **Search the Event Log**: Quickly find exactly what you want to see using search functionality.
- **Green Highlight on Final Submission**: Hover over the final form submission event, now highlighted in green, to easily identify when the form was successfully submitted.

Please note that these enhancements will apply only to **new certificates** moving forward and will not be retroactively applied to existing ones.

We’ve also updated our [community post](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4776894-trustedform-session-replay-enhancements) with all the details, be sure to check it out!

We hope these enhancements will make your session replays more insightful and easier to navigate.
