### New Add-On! Blacklist Alliance - Litigation Firewall for Email

This Add-On returns a basic value judgment about a given email address from a known litigator's database.

The Litigation Firewall for Email API provides direct access to Blacklist Alliance's Litigant Email Feed which consists of a feed of over 100,000 toxic email addresses belonging to known TCPA litigants, claimants, and class action attorneys, allowing you to filter email addresses tied to known TCPA litigants.
