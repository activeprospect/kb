### TrustedForm Verify: New column additions!

We are excited to announce the latest updates to TrustedForm Verify, which now includes two new columns: the Count column and the Sample Certificates column!

- **Count:** the counter shows the number of times a particular consent language was detected in certificates that were Retained or Verified.
- **Sample Certificates:** this allows you to view the most recently retained or verified certificate associated with the detected consent language.

With the following additions, you can easily track how often a particular consent language is detected and keep note of where the detected consent languages are coming from.
