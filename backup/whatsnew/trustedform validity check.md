### TrustedForm Validity Check

The new TrustedForm Validity Check feature was just released and gives you the ability to check if certificate URLs you receive are valid or not. This is extremely valuable to lead resellers so they can ensure all their leads have valid TrustedForm certificates and can put an end to guessing whether invalid certificates you were sent are completely fake or simply expired.

Read more about how it works in the [TrustedForm Validity Check community post](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5412855-trustedform-validity-check) and check out the [Validate API documentation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/validating-certificates/) for technical details.
