### TrustedForm: New UI Update

We have finally updated the TrustedForm UI to use a sidebar for navigation! We've given it a sleek, modern makeover to align with the look and feel of our other ActiveProspect products. Now, your key account features are conveniently nested in the left side panel, making it super intuitive to navigate. The best part? All the functionality you've come to rely on is right where you expect it.

We've introduced four tabs as part of this update:

- Home (formerly the Home tab)
- Certify (formerly the Issuing Certificates tab)
- Retain (formerly the Stored Certificates tab)
- Settings (formerly the Settings tab)

This change will greatly simplify the way you navigate between different products, improve visual consistency across our user interfaces, and enhance your overall experience!
