# Enhancement

A type of integration that is designed to validate or enhance (append data to) leads that enter a LeadConduit flow. LeadConduit provides enhancements you can purchase directly in the product, called third-party Add-On Services. You can also integrate with third party data enhancement services using one of our built-in integrations. Those often require that you have a business relationship with the provider.
