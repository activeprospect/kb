# Adding an Account Source to Your Flow

**Sources** receive lead data and can include:

- Your Landing Pages
- Your Favorite Lead Vendor
- A LeadConduit Account Holder

All Sources in LeadConduit have a tag to tell you whether they are an Account Source, a Standard Source, or a Custom Source.

#### Add The Source

**For another LeadConduit Account Holder** to send you leads, you'll need to add the Account as a Source in the LeadConduit flow of your choice. You can search for the Account or scroll through the list.

Once the Account has been added as a Source to your flow and saved, you need to send instructions (Submission Instructions) to your contact at the source so they can adjust their forms/systems to send lead data to LeadConduit at the URL and in a format that your LeadConduit flow accepts.

#### Send Submission Instructions to the Source

LeadConduit automatically generates a web-based submission instructions document specifically tailored to each Flow and Source. This document provides the correct URL to which to post the lead data, the fields that the flow accepts (both required and optional), an outline of that source's acceptance criteria logic, examples of an allowable request body, shown in LeadConduit's recognized data structure formats: Json, www/formurlencoded, and XML, and examples of LeadConduit response bodies for both success and failure outcomes.

Find the link to each source's Submission Instructions in the Flow ""Sources"" tab, as an icon in line with the Source name. Click on the icon to view the Submission Instructions document, then copy the document's URL from your browser address bar. Provide this URL to your Source contact, and be sure to tell them that this link is a link to their Submission Instructions document and that is it NOT actual submit URL for their form/system. That link is provided inside the document.

NOTE: Each source's Submission Instructions are unique, for each flow and Source. Do not use a different Source's Submission Instructions.

Once they configure their form/system to according to the Submission Instructions document, the Source Account Holder will be able to send leads to your Flow. You're good to go!
