# What information does TrustedForm make available to lead buyers?

The TrustedForm Certificate of Authenticity is generated by a script is placed on your web page. The Certificate includes the following pieces of information:

1. the URL of the page where the lead was collected
2. IP address of the user submitting the data
3. Browser and OS used by the consumer
4. Date and timestamp of when the user landed on the URL where the script is implemented
5. A snapshot of the HTML, images, CSS, javascript and other page assets as they appeared to the consumer
6. A session replay of the user's mouse movements and clicks, presented visually as an overlay superimposed on a local re-rendering of the snapshot.

The Certificate of Authenticity itself is stored by TrustedForm's servers and can be viewed at the web location identified by the trustedformcerturl field, which is a hidden field that TrustedForm creates and adds to your web page's forms during the user's visit.
