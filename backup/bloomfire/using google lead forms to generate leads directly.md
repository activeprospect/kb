# Using Google Lead Forms to Generate Leads Directly from Google Ads

Google Ads has a feature called Google lead form extensions, an option for advertisers to generate leads directly from their ad campaigns. These lead forms can be created and attached to both new and existing campaigns, allowing prospects to submit their information directly from the ad. Lead form extensions can collect information from a lead form such as:

- Name (can be customized as ""First name and last name"" or ""Full name"")
- Email
- Phone number
- City
- Zip / Postal code
- State / Province
- Country
- Company name
- Job title
- Work email
- Work phone number

To retrieve your leads, you’ll have to manually download them as a batch file or configure a webhook to send out automatically which can be cumbersome. With LeadConduit, we have an integration with the Google lead form webhook that allows you to instantly connect and send leads in real-time to any system without the need of your IT department. When combined with the power of other LeadConduit integrations, this empowers you to validate, enhance, and deliver these leads with just a few clicks.

To use LeadConduit’s [Google lead form webhook integration](https://activeprospect.com/integrations/google-lead-forms/), open your flow editor and create a new source. You can give the source any label you choose, but be sure to select Google lead form webhook from the list of inbound integrations. Save your flow and copy the submission URL from the posting instructions of the newly created source. This submission URL is what you’ll use when configuring the lead form webhook.
