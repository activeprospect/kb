# How to Retrieve Your Retained TrustedForm Certificates

The TrustedForm Certificate URL is your key to future protection.

To prepare you for making the most of your TrustedForm retained certificates, here are a few tips to follow:

- Be sure that each lead's retained TrustedForm Certificate URL is sent to and stored as a URL in your system of record. The TrustedForm certificate URL must be used to retrieve a certificate in the event of a consumer complaint. A certificate can't be retrieved in any other way. Other data fields such as email, phone, or lead ID are not sufficient to retrieve a certificate.
- TrustedForm certificate URLs may be hundreds of characters in length, so be sure to allocate a large enough string field in your system of record.
