# TrustedForm Insights

Insights is a TrustedForm product that allows you to retrieve a wide range of metadata that gives you the capacity to gain an intuitive understanding of your leads. Using a TrustedForm Certificate URL you are able to make a simple API call that will return information you need to:

- Increase your conversion rate

- Lower your cost per lead

- Make efficient bids in ping/post auctions

- [Optimize](https://activeprospect.com/resources/lead-optimization-wp-lp/) your your lead purchasing strategy

- And more!


# How It Works

Ask your lead vendors to use [TrustedForm Certify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/certify/) and send a TrustedForm Certificate URL along with the lead. Then use our [API to retrieve insights](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v3.0/tag/Retrieving-Insights/) for your lead and send them to the system you use to make purchasing decisions. Search for correlations with your disposition data and use this information to set acceptance criteria, filters, bids and routing destinations that progress your business goals.

# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **How do I get access to TrustedForm Insights?**

Contact your account administrator or sales@activepropsect.com for purchase.

2. **Will this allow me to view and retain TrustedForm certificates?**

No, in order to view TrustedForm certificates you must v [erify that you own the domain it originated from](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4649879-verify-domain-ownership) or use TrustedForm Retain to store the certificate in your account.

3. **How long am I able to use TrustedForm Insights to retrieve metadata from a TrustedForm certificate?**

For all certificates, until the TrustedForm certificate's claim period expires (3 or 90 days). All certificates expire, regardless of whether they were retained or not. Retaining it means even after it’s expired, you’ll still have a copy stored in your account. Once a certificate expires, you can no longer perform any operations or make any requests on it.

4. **If I have both the TrustedForm Insights and Trusted Consent products how can I retrieve the metadata without retaining the certificate in my account?**

Using a [ping API request](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v3.0/tag/Ping/) will do this as certificates are not expected to be retained during the ping (bidding phase of ping/post auctions).

5. **How can I retrieve insights for certificates in bulk?**

In order to do this you must store the properties included in the TrustedForm API response in a CRM or other system designed to store data and retrieve it from there.

6. **What information can I acquire using TrustedForm Insights?**
