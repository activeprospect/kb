# Why can't I just pass the data without using TrustedForm?

TrustedForm is a neutral 3rd party lead certification service. TrustedForm gives lead buyers confidence that the information being passed is correct. So even if you are already passing this information, TrustedForm provides 3rd party verification that it is correct.

These types of services are common across all types of industries. For example, when you buy a diamond it typically comes with a certificate provided by the GIA (Gemological Institute of America) or AGS (American Gem Society). Financial statements are another example. Public companies must have their financial statements audited by 3rd parties, giving investors confidence to actively invest in the stock market. Similarly, TrustedForm will give lead buyers confidence in their leads.
