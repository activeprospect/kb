# How do I send a test lead from Facebook?

You can follow these steps to send a test lead with real data from Facebook:

1. Click here: [https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing)
2. Choose the Facebook Page where you want to insert the test lead
3. Click on the **Delete lead** button in case you've already submitted a lead from your Facebook account on this form. In fact, leads can only be submitted once to a particular form
4. Click on the **Preview form** (do not click on **Create lead** button, as this will send the test lead with the _[test@fb.com](mailto:test@fb.com)_ email address)
5.  Insert any valid email and data
6.  Click on **Submit**

If you are **an Admin/Owner** of the Page and have all Facebook Business Manager Permissions, including the LeadsBridge app as a CRM, attached to that Page, you will see the following response from Facebook:

Once done, the test leads will appear in LeadsBridge and in your CRM/Autoresponder.

## Important notes:

1. Test leads are counted as organic leads and won’t be associated with an Ad.
2. You are allowed to send one test lead per Form. To test more than once, click on Delete Lead first to remove the previous test. This action will only delete the test lead created from Facebook.
3. The [test@fb.com](mailto:test@fb.com) is a fake lead that won’t be recognized by lots of CRM/Autoresponders. In this case, we suggest sending a test lead using real information.
4. If you get the **_103 error: CRM access has been revoked from Lead Access Manager -_** it means that you need to grant LeadsBridge correct permissions to access your Facebook leads. Please consult our community article on [how to enable the right Facebook permissions](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5070199-why-aren-t-leads-synced-in-real-time-from-facebook-lead-ads-to-my-crm).
