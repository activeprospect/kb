# Can I implement TrustedForm with dynamic forms?

Yes! Our Certificate contains a copy of the HTML as seen by the consumer when the script is added to the page. That HTML is visible by anyone with access to the certificate. Even if you have a dynamic form, you'll be able to provide the advertiser with assurance that you are representing their offer correctly.
