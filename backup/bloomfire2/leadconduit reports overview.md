# LeadConduit Reports Overview

**What Do LeadConduit Reports Do?**

LeadConduit reports display lead statistics: The counts of leads that meet user-defined criteria.

**Statistics vs Data:**

LeadConduit reports do not display specific Lead Data. To obtain lead data, use the “Leads” → “Leads” or the “Leads” → “Lead Events” views from LeadConduit's sidebar menu.

**Pre-Built reports:**

Your account includes a selection of commonly-used reports. You can copy and customize those reports, and you can create new custom reports from scratch.

**Customizing Reports:**

LeadConduit reports are highly customizable.

- You can **choose** which statistical items a report's columns display.
- You can **filter** the data being reported on by time, flow, source, recipient, enhancement step, lead outcome, flow field, and appended data.
- You can **group,** or “break out” the reported statistics by flow, source, recipient, enhancement step, outcome, field and appended data values.
- You can dynamically change a report’s **time frame** at will without copying or re-creating the report.
- You can add a brief memo to a report. The memo displays  between the report's title and body.

**Exporting Report Tables:**

You can export any displayed table to a **csv text file** that you can import into your spreadsheet or business intelligence application.

**Viewing the Underlying Data:**

Report entries are each linked to a related LeadConduit “Leads” → “Lead Events” views, where you can see the leads that contributed to that entry. You must be logged into LeadConduit to view Lead Events.

**Sharing Reports with Others:**

You can create (and revoke) a **shareable link** to any report. The viewer of a shared version of a report can change the time frame displayed, but otherwise cannot edit the content or format of the reports but does not cannot edit the report content. Viewers of the shared version of a report do not get the links to the underlying “Lead Events” views, so they can’t see the underlying lead data.
