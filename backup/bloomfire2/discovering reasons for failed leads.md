# Discovering Reasons for Failed Leads

LeadConduit makes it easy to figure out why your leads are failing.

# Using ""View Leads"" to See Failure Reasons

There are two main ways to find the reason behind failed leads, the first way is through the “ **View Leads**” tab inside LeadConduit.

This view provides you with a quick overview of why your leads have failed through the “outcome” and “reason” columns. You can change the date range to view any day and the interface will update and show you all of the leads that came in during the selected date range.

# Get More Info on Specific Leads

You may see some leads in the list that you want to expand and look at in greater detail. You can copy the lead ID and paste it in the search bar to pull up an expanded view of the chosen lead.

## Using the ""Explore Lead Events"" to look at lead errors and failures in detail

The second way to get information on why leads failed is to go through the “Explore Lead Events” tab; this view offers a wide of filters and tools to get information of failed leads, error and other events.

You can think of the “Explore Lead Events” page as a screener to view leads based on specific days, from specific flows and sources that contain specific information you are looking for. Use this page to narrow down your failed leads and isolate their specific reasons for failing.

1. Pick the time frame in which your failed leads may have come in (today, yesterday, a month ago, etc.). The interface will show leads in the selected time-frame.
2. You can view leads as events or outcome reasons. The outcome reasons view is an easy way to see a list of all the reasons why leads failed on or between specific dates.
3. There are two basic views for screening leads, the first is the basic view, which is what is shown by default. The second option is advanced, which gives you more detailed options to screen leads (fields: first name, last name, phone number. Specific integrations used, etc.).
4. Basic view also lets you narrow down leads based on

- Submission from sources or Deliveries to recipients, or sent or received Feedback.
- The flow they went through.
- The outcome after going through the flow (failure, success, error).
- The Source the submitted the lead.
- The Recipient step.

## Going into detail on a lead

After you have narrowed down the results to the lead(s) that you were looking for, you can see what happened to a single lead after it went through a flow, what step it failed at, etc.

Clicking on a lead event will open an expanded view of that lead. From there, you can see what exactly happened during a leads trip through a flow. You can even see the technical details on why it failed.

The left hand side will show you how far a lead made it through a flow before it failed. The very last step will always show you why a lead failed (assuming you have filters in place to catch your failures). In the example above, the lead was stopped at a filter that had rules in place. The step information shows you the outcome and reason for a leads failure.

The lead in the example above failed because it met some conditions in a filter. The filer had a rule in place to not allow leads to pass (continue down the flow) if the lead’s state was “OH” or “Ohio”.

## The technical details also show failure information.
