# LeadConduit 101: Submission Instructions

# Overview

LeadConduit automatically generates instructions for sending lead data for each source in a flow. The instructions are called Submission Instructions and they are unique to each source. Submission Instructions  provide details on where to send the information (a Posting URL) and a list of fields the flow will accept. It also provides some insight into what kind of leads the flow will and won’t accept, as well as an interactive example.

# Submission Instructions Sections

At the top right of the page is a ""share"" button and an ""Import Leads"" button for the leads provider to get started. Before they do that, though, they should review the individual sections on this page, as there is important information about what is accepted, how it is accepted, etc. These sections are hyperlinked on the left under ""Table of Contents"", so clicking on a section header will jump them directly to that section.

**Overview:** Explains how to use the Submission Doc and who to contact if there are issues.

**Submission URL:** Provides the URL for that customer's specific LeadConduit flow.

**HTTP Method:** Provides instructions on how to submit the leads, such as with GET or POST (recommended), using JSON or XML, etc., as well as what types of responses to expect (success, failure, or error) and in what format they will be provided. Selecting the Method in the dropdown will change the examples shown below.
