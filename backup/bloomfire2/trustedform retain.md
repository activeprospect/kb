# TrustedForm Retain

Retain is a TrustedForm product that allows you to view and store TrustedForm certificates that can be used to prove what took place during a lead event. Use this to perform manual audits of lead generation or as evidence during lawsuits. Make sure your certificates show [prior express written consent](https://activeprospect.com/blog/tcpa-consent/) was obtained properly. If not, demand that your suppliers change their practices and only provide leads with certificates that do. All you need is a TrustedForm Certificate URL to make a simple API call that will retain the certificate in your account. If you are generating certificates you also have the option to use the [Auto-Retain](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4812756-trustedform-auto-retain-for-first-party-lead-certification) feature and make the process even easier. Use TrustedForm Retain to do the following:

- Prove how leads were created

- Audit lead generation practices

- Visually see a recreation of lead events

- And more!


**How it Works**

Ask your lead vendors to use [TrustedForm Certify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/certify/) and send a TrustedForm Certificate URL along with the lead. Then immediately use the [TrustedForm Certificate API](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Certificate-URL/) to make a request for the certificate to be retained in your account. This requires that you provide the email and/or phone number of the lead associated with the certificate in order to perform [lead matching](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4766190-trustedform-lead-matching) in attempt to make sure that the two belong together. Make sure to store the Certificate URL in your CRM or wherever your lead data is stored so that you can retrieve the correct certificate for any lead later on. Once retained, you can access that certificate from it's URL for 5 years.
