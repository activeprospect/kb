# Invite to Connect for Buyers

## Why should I use this?

Some of the values you get as a buyer by inviting your seller as a source with this new feature are:

- Streamline your communication - automatically share your Submission Docs with your partner.
- Connect with your partners on ActiveProspect and formalize your working relationship by creating your seller as a Source in your Flow for efficient use in other Flow.
- Your partner will get access to a free LeadConduit for Partners account.

## How does it work?

The process for adding a Source is slightly different if that Source represents another ActiveProspect account or a potential ActiveProspect account.

From the LeadConduit inviter's perspective, how you add a new vendor source will vary depending on whether the seller is already connected to your account or not.

#### Adding an Account Source with which you are already connected

1. Create or Edit the Flow in which you want to add a lead Seller you’ve already connected with; go to the Sources tab and click on the Add Source button.

2. You’ll see the Account Sources already connected to your account in the _Select a source_ dropdown.

3. Once you add an Account Source to your Flow, your partner will automatically have access to your Flow’s Submission Docs from their LeadConduit account.

#### Adding an Account Source with which you are not connected

1. Create or Edit the Flow in which you want to add a lead Seller you haven't already connected with; go to the _Sources_ tab and click on the _Add Source_ button.

5. You’ll now find the email address to which the invite was sent as an _Account Source (Connection Pending)_ in your Flow Sources.



You can start adding Rules and Mapping for this Source if needed; however, the Account Source will be disabled until the invite has been accepted.

6. The invitee will receive an email like the following:

7. Once accepted, the pending Source will be converted into the Account Source from which the invite was accepted.



Any Rules and Mappings you may have configured will remain the same.

## FAQ

1. **Are there any requirements for using Invite to Connect as a lead Buyer?**



The only requirement for a lead Buyer is an ActiveProspect account with a _LeadConduit Base_ or _Pro_ subscription.

2. **How does this work for the Seller?**



See [THIS](https://community.activeprospect.com/series/5554657/posts/5554684) article for details on how Invite to Connect works for lead sellers.

3. **What happens if the Seller doesn’t have an ActiveProspect account?**



If the Seller doesn’t have an ActiveProspect account, they can create one for free from your invitation, which will give them access to a free _LeadConduit for Partners_ subscription.

4. **What happens if the Seller has an ActiveProspect account but doesn’t have access to LeadConduit?**



It might happen that the Seller already has an ActiveProspect account that only has access to TrustedForm; when they accept your invitation with that account, they will be automatically assigned a free _LeadConduit for Partners_ subscription.

This LeadConduit subscription will allow them to easily access the [Submission Docs](https://app.leadconduit.com/submissiondocs) for any current or future Flow, in which you might include them as an Account Source.

5. **What happens if the Seller already has an ActiveProspect account with access to LeadConduit?**



If the Seller accepts the invitation with an account that previously had access to LeadConduit, your Flow’s Submission Docs will be automatically assigned to their account.

6. **Does this new feature change how I assign and use Source integrations in my Flows?**



No, adding a Source representing a specific integration, such as Facebook, remains the same.
