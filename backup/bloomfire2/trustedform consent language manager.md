# TrustedForm Consent Language Manager

The TrustedForm Consent Language Manager (CLM) is used to keep track of which variations of consent language your business has approved to be presented to the leads you contact. It will be automatically populated with consent languages found when TrustedForm [Retain](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/retain) or [Verify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/verify) are used. We recommend consulting with your legal/compliance team to determine whether specific variations meet their requirements and are safe for you to use. Any variation you approve should be sufficient on its own to comply with the advertising/marketing regulations applicable to your business such as the [Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_Consumer_Protection_Act_of_1991). The classifications established here will be used to conduct [TrustedForm Verify's Approved Language Check](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474009-trustedform-verify-approved-language-check) to help your business mitigate risk by giving you the means to reject or flag leads that were generated without proper consent.

# How It Works

There are 3 sections of the CLM that help you manage the approval process of consent languages with the least effort possible. These should be regularly reviewed to ensure that you are properly vetting your leads.

**Unreviewed Consent Language**

This section shows you variations that have appeared on TrustedForm certificates that you have verified or retained but haven't been classified yet. This is the most important section to take action on to ensure that you accept/reject the leads that you want to. Sort columns like first/last seen or count to help you determine which variations are the most important to review. Phone numbers and email addresses will now appear as placeholders, **{{phone}}** and **{{email}}**,to prevent unnecessary duplicates. This section has a limit of 1000 consent languages so make sure to review them regularly so that there is always space for newly detected consent languages.

**Approved Consent Language**

This section shows you variations which you have already approved. It is important to update these if your business requirements change. Leave notes on each variation so that you can keep track of the reasoning behind approving it or changes made to it.

**Rejected Consent Language**

This sections shows you variations which you have determined do not meet your business requirements and should be rejected. Visit here if you ever want to know why or when a variation was rejected or if you find that you actually want to change your mind and approve it.
