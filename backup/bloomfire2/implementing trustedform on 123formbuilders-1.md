# Implementing TrustedForm on 123FormBuilders

How to add TrustedForm to a 123FormBuilders form.

Begin by logging into your FormBuilders account.

Select the form you want to use with TrustedForm by clicking edit or create a new form:

Then click on 'Advanced' on the left side bar:

Then click on the 'Form' tab. Then select 'Add a JS script to your form'.

Here we will be entering the URL of a .js file which holds the TrustedForm script.

To do that, first create a JS file that holds our TrustedForm script, then upload the JS file on a trusted web server or your own and use the URL where the file is located (e.g. https://mydomain.com/my-javascript.js). There are web services that host JavaScript files for you, but they represent certain risks, such as data corruption or service retirement. Thatâ€™s the reason why it is best to host them on a web service where you have administrative access.

Once you have entered the URL of the JS file, click on 'Save', as follows:

That's it! Now you should be able to publish and test the form, and the certificates should be created successfully.
