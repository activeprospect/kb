# How do I reauthorize my Facebook Ad Account?

If you are connected to your LeadsBridge account via Facebook Ad Account, it could happen that your Facebook Ad Account has expired or some information has been changed on the Facebook side. In those cases, you should reauthorize your account in order to refresh your Facebook account connection with LeadsBridge.

In order to reauthorize your Facebook Ad Account while using different  bridge configurations, you should follow the steps below:

### Complex Bridge

1. Log in to the **Facebook account** you’ve connected with LeadsBridge
2. Then, log in to your **LeadsBridge account**
3. On the left column, go to **Facebook Suite** » **[Ad Accounts](https://leadsbridge.com/app/adAccounts)**
4. **Click** on the **name** of the Facebook account you want to re-authorize (it should be the same one you’ve logged on the first step)
5. **Click** on the **Reauthorize** button, as shown in the screenshot below:

7\. Once done, you’ll be redirected back to LeadsBridge.

#### **What does ""Error validating access token: the user has changed the password"" mean?**

The following error shows up when the password for the account has been changed, as it stops LeadsBridge from accessing it. To fix this, you should **Reauthorize** the Ad Account from which you have changed the password.
