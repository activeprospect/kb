# How do I choose the right LeadsBridge plan for me?

LeadsBridge offers 4 pricing plans:

- The **Free plan**, is a self-service free forever plan.

- The **Starter plan**, is a basic self-service paid plan.

- The **Pro plan**, is a self-service paid plan.

- The **Business plan**, is a managed paid plan.


## Free plan

Our Free plan allows you to **connect all the top advertising platforms** – including Facebook, Instagram, Google, Youtube, LinkedIn, and TikTok – **and webforms with your favorite marketing tools**, to move leads across platforms in real-time, for free.

This plan **includes 1 running bridge**, it lets you sync up to **2 fields** (like Name and Email, for example),and allows you to **move 50 leads per month**. What does this mean? It means that inside your LeadsBridge platform you can potentially have more than one bridge, but you can only have one bridge up and running at a time.

And if you don’t have a CRM, don’t worry. With this plan, you can **send automated welcome emails to your prospects for free** without needing any sort of CRM system.

The Free plan is a **perfect fit for all marketers who are approaching the advertising world for the first time**. And if they need support, they can rely on our [community articles](https://community.activeprospect.com/).

## Starter Plan

If you need to be able to have more than 1 bridge running at the same time, the Starter plan is your best option, and a great solution if you have a small budget but still need to run multiple automations.

This plan’s starting point includes 3 bridges and 800 leads per month, and it lets you sync up to **6 fields** for $29 a month (billed annually). From there, you can fully customize your plan with as many bridges and as many leads as you need (for a maximum threshold of 2,000 leads/mo and 6 bridges). The monthly fee will be adjusted accordingly.

Starter users have the opportunity to receive a notification via email every time a lead interacts with their ad or web form.

The Email Receipt feature allows all paying LeadsBridge users to keep track and have a better understanding of their lead generation efforts. So, after completing the bridge creation, a little switch button will activate this feature and you will start receiving notification emails about each new lead coming in.

Everything that is included in the Free plan is also included in the Starter plan. Plus, you will have access to [Online-to-Offline Tracking](https://leadsbridge.com/conversions-sync/).

You have 14 days to try it for free - no credit card required \- and see if it works for you. And if you need help, you can rely on our Customer Support Team to assist you by email.

## Pro Plan

**If you’re a seasoned marketer** who needs to transfer loads of lead data by using complex bridges and formulas, **the Pro plan is what best fits your needs**.

It allows you to generate an **interconnected marketing ecosystem**, which will help you build a **stronger omnichannel strategy**.

The Pro plan starting point includes **15** **bridges and 2.000 leads per month,and it lets you sync up to 40 fields for $79 a month**(paid annually). From there, you can fully **customize your plan** with as many bridges and as many leads as you need and the monthly **fee will adjust accordingly**.

**Everything that is included in the Starter plan is also included in the Pro plan**. Plus, you will have **access to all complex** [**automotive CRMs**](https://leadsbridge.com/integrations/categories/automotive-software/ ""https://leadsbridge.com/integrations/categories/automotive-software/"") (such as ADF/XML, VinSolutions, DealerSocket, elead, and more), [**Gym & Fitness apps**](https://leadsbridge.com/integrations/categories/gym-fitness-management/ ""https://leadsbridge.com/integrations/categories/gym-fitness-management/"") (such as Mindbody), webhooks, devs tools, [**Custom Audiences**](https://leadsbridge.com/custom-audiences-sync/ ""https://leadsbridge.com/custom-audiences-sync/""), and [**Online-to-Offline Tracking**](https://leadsbridge.com/conversions-sync/ ""https://leadsbridge.com/conversions-sync/"").

## Business plan

If you can’t find the integration you need inside our integrations list, or you have to integrate with your own CRM, don’t worry. We are ready to develop an integration, specifically for you. With the Business plan, you can **rely on our team of developers to build a** [**custom integration**](https://leadsbridge.com/custom-integration/ ""https://leadsbridge.com/custom-integration/"") **that fits your business needs** and handle everything for you. This way, you won’t have to hire developers or devote your own developers’ time to building and monitoring the integration.

You can even add SALM single sign-on (SSO) to ensure secure access to your LeadsBridge account.

With the Business plan, you will have a **dedicated LeadsBridge Customer Success Manager**, who will support you and guide you in setting up and managing your account, allowing you to have **immediate contact with a Partner Solution Engineer**. We offer VIP and SLA support, and if your company requires a **vendor security assessment**, we can make that happen for you with a Business plan.

## How to define how many bridges you need while selecting/upgrading your plan?

Each one of our plans allows you to **create unlimited bridges**. The threshold indicated in each plan only defines **how many bridges can be live and running data at the same time**. Moreover, how many bridges you need is defined by your use case. For example:

- Lead Ads/web form to CRM: Each form is a bridge.

- Webinar (as source or destination): Each webinar is a bridge.

- Google Sheets (as source or destination): Each Google Sheet is a bridge.

- CRM/Email System (as source or destination): Each segment, entity, and list is a bridge.

- Mindbody: Each Site ID/location ID is a bridge.

- Calendar (e.g. Calendly): Each calendar is a bridge.

- Custom Audiences: Each Custom Audience is a bridge.

- Offline Conversion API: Each event is a bridge.

- Chatbot: Each chatbot is a bridge.


Let’s get into more detail with some **additional examples**.

### Example \#1

You use Salesforce as a CRM system and you generate leads from 3 different channels: you have 2 forms on Facebook Lead Ads, 2 forms on LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms, and 1 form on your website. In total, you have 5 forms, therefore you need 5 bridges.

### Example \#2

Your CRM system is HubSpot and you use Zoom Webinar. You have 3 different webinars scheduled on Zoom and you would like to connect each webinar to HubSpot. Each webinar needs its own bridge, so you need 3 bridges in total.

### Example \#3

You use Mindbody, you have 2 Site/Location IDs, and you have 6 forms on Facebook Lead Ads. You would like to split your forms into 2 groups and connect 3 forms to each one of your Mindbody Site/Location IDs. So, 3 forms to 1 Site/Location ID and 3 other forms to the second Site/Location ID. Considering that each form is a bridge, you need 6 bridges in total.

### Example \#4

You have a Salesforce list with 3000 contacts and would like to send these contacts to different Custom Audiences as follows: 500 contacts to one Custom Audience on Facebook, 500 contacts to another Custom Audience on Facebook, 1000 contacts to a Custom Audience on Google, 1000 contacts to a Custom Audience on LinkedIn. In this case, you need 4 bridges total, one for each Custom Audience (2 for Facebook, 1 for Google, and 1 for LinkedIn). This logic applies also to the CAPI use case.
