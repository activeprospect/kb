Get familiar with LeadsBridge's most used terms!

### App

A platform that is available to be connected in LeadsBridge. An app can be implemented or not (on the waiting list).

### Bridge

A Bridge is a connection between two platforms/applications. The connection foresees two entities. Hence it's not possible to have a bridge between multiple sources and destinations.

### Integration

Is the “instance” of an app w/ all the credentials defined (e.g., SFDC with the user already authenticated using the Oauth).

There could be multiple integrations for the same app.

The UI will call integration as “account”.

### Source

It is the integration that sends data to the destination (e.g: Facebook Lead Ads). Leadsbridge retrieves data from the source.

### Destination

It is the integration where data are passed to. It receives the data form the Source (e.g: Google Sheets). LeadsBridge ingest/push data to the destination.
