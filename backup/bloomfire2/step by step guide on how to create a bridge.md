# Step by step guide on how to create a Bridge

**Step by step guide on how to create a bridge**

If you are starting now on using LeadsBridge, this guide is for you: you will see how to build a Simple Bridge step by step.

**Step 1:** Click on the ‘ _Create new Bridge_’ button

**Step 2:** Choose the apps you want to connect.

LeadsBridge offers integrations with more than [300 integrations](https://leadsbridge.com/integrations/). Please note that some integrations are available only starting from the [Pro Plan](https://leadsbridge.com/pricing/)and also that some of them are available only as a Source and others only as Destination.

[Here](https://leadsbridge.com/pro-plan-pricing/ ""https://leadsbridge.com/pro-plan-pricing/"") you have a full view of the Pro plan pricing table. Also, check [this article](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5039672-how-do-i-choose-the-right-plan-for-me)to learn more about our Pro plan features.

In this example, we have chosen two widely used Integrations: [Facebook Lead Ads and Google Sheet](https://leadsbridge.com/integrations/facebook-lead-ads/google-sheets/).

**Step 3:** Select Source and Destination

Define which specific assets you want to connect to LeadsBridge as Source and Destination. A dialog box will be opened with the specific integration you have chosen in order to authorize LeadsBridge to access these assets of your interest.

**Step 4:** Choose the assets involved in the sync

After the Authentication,you are able to re-define every asset involved in the Bridge. The example below shows how to create a new Lead Ad form in case you don’t have any yet on the Page you’ve selected. Otherwise, the dropdown menu will show you the available forms.

This step needs to be done also on the Destination side, as shown in the example. Once you have done with both the Source and Destination, you are ready to proceed to the next step.

**Step 5:** Map the fields

The _Fields mapping_ Step will allow you to set where the data coming from the Source will be synced to your destination. You can leave empty the fields you don’t need to map, such as ‘Campaign’ and ‘Created time’ in the example on the next step.

Alternatively, if you need to map the additional fields that are not visible on the step, you can click **Show unmapped fields** near the search option to get the full visibility of your destination fields and proceed with mapping.

**Step 6:** Test and Publish

Once you’ve mapped all the fields you need, you are now ready for the final steps you can decide if to run a test or publish the Bridge straight away.

If you decide to test the Bridge, you will have the chance to insert test info that you’ll be then able to retrieve easily into your destination.

Once the test has been successful, you are now ready to **Publish** the Bridge.

**Step 7: Well done, you’ve published your first Bridge**

You can now proceed with the creation of another Bridge or go back to the main dashboard
