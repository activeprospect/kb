## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1 - Integration Guides**: The specific integration guides (Infusionsoft, Pixel Tracker, Speak2Leads, SendGrid) should be reviewed and potentially added to the integrations section.

2. **Priority 2 - Platform-Specific Implementations**: The form builder implementations for 123FormBuilders, Formidable, and Landbot should be added to the form-builder-integrations guide.

3. **Priority 3 - Glossaries**: Consider creating a unified glossary section that combines all glossary content.

4. **Priority 4 - Advanced Topics**: Some of the advanced TrustedForm and LeadConduit topics might warrant their own sections in the advanced guides.

5. **Consider Skipping**: Person profiles, meta documentation about the knowledge base itself, and home/login pages are likely not needed in the new structure.
