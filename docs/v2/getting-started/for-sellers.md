# LeadConduit for Lead Sellers

## Your Distribution Command Center

As a lead seller, you know the challenge: every buyer has different requirements, technical specifications, and quality standards. You're juggling multiple integrations, tracking acceptance rates, and constantly dealing with rejection reconciliation.

LeadConduit transforms your lead distribution from a technical nightmare into a streamlined, profitable operation.

üìç **You are here**: Learning how LeadConduit empowers lead sellers
üìä **What's at stake**: Your acceptance rates and operational efficiency  
üéØ **Your goal**: Seamless delivery to every buyer, every time

## The Lead Seller's Challenge

### What You're Dealing With

Every lead seller faces these daily battles:

**The Integration Complexity**
- 20 buyers = 20 different APIs
- Each wants different field names
- Various authentication methods
- Unique error handling per buyer

**The Quality Puzzle**
- Buyer A wants phones validated
- Buyer B requires TrustedForm
- Buyer C only takes certain states
- Buyer D has hourly caps

**The Reconciliation Nightmare**
- Vague rejection reasons
- No standardized reporting
- Manual tracking in spreadsheets
- Disputes eat up profits

### The Hidden Costs

Beyond the obvious technical burden:
- **Developer time** building and maintaining integrations
- **Operational overhead** managing delivery queues
- **Lost revenue** from preventable rejections
- **Relationship strain** from integration issues

## How LeadConduit Empowers Sellers

### 1. Universal Buyer Interface

One integration to rule them all:

```
Your Leads ‚Üí LeadConduit ‚Üí Buyer A (their format)
                        ‚Üí Buyer B (their format)
                        ‚Üí Buyer C (their format)
                        ‚Üí All future buyers
```

**Real Impact**: Solar lead seller reduced integration time from 2 weeks per buyer to 2 hours.

### 2. Intelligent Pre-Processing

Know leads will be accepted BEFORE sending:

**Pre-Flight Checks**:
- Validate data format
- Verify buyer criteria match
- Check current caps
- Confirm business hours

**Result**: Send only leads that CAN be accepted, dramatically improving acceptance rates.

### 3. Complete Delivery Transparency

See everything, prove everything:

**For Every Lead**:
- Exact data sent
- Precise timestamp
- Buyer's response
- Specific rejection reason

No more "he said, she said" disputes.

## Essential Features for Sellers

### Smart Field Mapping

Handle every buyer's unique requirements:

**Buyer A wants**:
```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "primaryPhone": "5551234567",
  "stateCode": "CA"
}
```

**Buyer B wants**:
```json
{
  "contact_first": "John",
  "phone1": "(555) 123-4567",
  "state": "California"
}
```

**You send once**: LeadConduit handles the transformation.

### Conditional Enhancement

Add data only when needed:

```yaml
For Buyer A:
  - No enhancement needed
  
For Buyer B:
  - Validate phone
  - Append TrustedForm
  
For Buyer C:
  - Validate phone
  - Check DNC
  - Append demographics
```

Pay for enhancements only when buyers require (and pay for) them.

### Intelligent Routing

Send each lead to its best destination:

**Waterfall Logic**:
1. Try exclusive buyer first ($50/lead)
2. If rejected, try semi-exclusive ($25/lead)
3. If rejected, try shared buyers ($10/lead)
4. If still rejected, send to remediation

**Simultaneous Delivery**:
- Send to multiple non-competing buyers
- Track acceptance from each
- Maximize revenue per lead

### Real-Time Feedback

Know immediately what happened:

**Success Response**:
```json
{
  "result": "success",
  "id": "buyer-lead-12345",
  "price": 25.00
}
```

**Rejection Response**:
```json
{
  "result": "failure",
  "reason": "duplicate",
  "details": "Lead previously received 2024-01-08",
  "reference": "buyer-lead-98765"
}
```

Clear, actionable feedback you can use to improve.

## Building Your Seller Flow

### Step 1: Standardize Your Data

Create your canonical lead format:

**Standard Fields**:
- first_name, last_name
- email, phone
- address, city, state, zip
- ip_address, timestamp
- source_url, opt_in

Map incoming variations to these standards.

### Step 2: Add Universal Enhancements

Enhance once, use everywhere:

**Core Validations**:
- Email validity check
- Phone type detection
- State standardization
- Timestamp normalization

**Compliance Additions**:
- TrustedForm retrieval
- DNC checking
- TCPA compliance flags

### Step 3: Configure Buyer Requirements

For each buyer, set up:

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```yaml
Buyer: ABC Insurance Leads
States: CA, TX, FL only
Age: 25-64
Phone: Valid mobile only
Consent: TrustedForm required
```

**Delivery Format**:
- Their API endpoint
- Authentication method
- Field mappings
- Response parsing

**Business Rules**:
- Daily cap: 1000 leads
- Hourly cap: 50 leads
- Business hours: 8am-8pm EST
- Weekend delivery: No

### Step 4: Implement Smart Routing

Build your distribution logic:

**Priority Routing**:
```
If state = "CA" AND age < 35:
  ‚Üí Buyer A (premium young CA buyer)
Else if insurance_type = "auto":
  ‚Üí Buyer B, C, D (auto insurance buyers)
Else:
  ‚Üí Buyer E (general insurance)
```

**Revenue Optimization**:
- Track acceptance rates by buyer
- Route to highest-paying accepting buyer
- Implement dynamic pricing tiers

## Maximizing Your Distribution

### Improve Acceptance Rates

Use data to fix problems:

**Common Rejections**:
- "Invalid phone" ‚Üí Add phone validation
- "Missing consent" ‚Üí Require TrustedForm
- "Outside service area" ‚Üí Pre-filter by state
- "Duplicate" ‚Üí Check before sending

**Proactive Optimization**:
- Monitor rejection patterns
- Update pre-filters
- Adjust routing rules
- Communicate changes to sources

### Scale Without Complexity

Add new buyers easily:

**Traditional Way**:
- Week 1: Get buyer specs
- Week 2-3: Build integration
- Week 4: Test and debug
- Week 5: Go live (maybe)

**LeadConduit Way**:
- Hour 1: Create buyer entity
- Hour 2: Configure delivery
- Hour 3: Test and go live

### Automate Operations

Let the system handle complexity:

**Automatic Retries**:
- Buyer system down? Retry later
- Temporary cap? Queue and retry
- Business hours? Hold until open

**Smart Queuing**:
- Priority delivery for premium leads
- Batch delivery for bulk buyers
- Real-time for ping/post

**Cap Management**:
- Track across all criteria
- Prevent over-delivery
- Optimize cap utilization

## Advanced Seller Strategies

### Ping/Post Implementation

Maximize revenue with real-time bidding:

**Ping Phase**:
```
1. Receive partial lead data
2. Send ping to multiple buyers
3. Collect bids
4. Accept highest bid
```

**Post Phase**:
```
1. Receive full lead data
2. Deliver to winning bidder
3. Confirm acceptance
4. Handle backup buyers if needed
```

### Multi-Tier Distribution

Create sophisticated routing:

**Exclusive Tier** ($40-60/lead):
- First right of refusal
- Highest quality requirements
- Premium pricing

**Semi-Exclusive Tier** ($20-30/lead):
- 2-3 buyers maximum
- Geographic or vertical exclusivity
- Mid-tier pricing

**Shared Tier** ($5-15/lead):
- Unlimited buyers
- Volume distribution
- Base pricing

### Performance-Based Routing

Route based on buyer behavior:

**Acceptance Score**:
```
Buyer A: 95% acceptance ‚Üí Priority routing
Buyer B: 70% acceptance ‚Üí Secondary routing
Buyer C: 40% acceptance ‚Üí Last resort
```

**Payment Performance**:
- Fast payers get priority
- Slow payers get queued
- Non-payers get paused
