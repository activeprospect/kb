# Lead Events

## Every Lead Tells a Story

Events are the heartbeat of LeadConduit - they capture every significant moment in a lead's journey from submission to conversion. Think of them as a detailed travel log that shows not just where a lead went, but when, why, and what happened at each stop.

üìç **You are here**: Understanding the event system that powers visibility
üìä **What you'll discover**: How to read, analyze, and act on event data
üéØ **The outcome**: Complete operational transparency and optimization

## The Event Model

### What Events Capture

Every event records:
- **When**: Precise timestamp
- **What**: Specific action type
- **Who**: Which entity was involved
- **Where**: Which step in the flow
- **Why**: Outcome and reasons
- **How**: Duration and details

### Event Categories

Events fall into major categories:

```yaml
Journey Events:
  - Source events (submission/acceptance/rejection)
  - Filter events (routing decisions)
  - Recipient events (delivery attempts)
  - Feedback events (post-delivery outcomes)

System Events:
  - Enhancement events (data append)
  - Error events (technical issues)
  - Flow events (completion tracking)
```

## Event Types Deep Dive

### üì• [Source Events](./source-events)
*The beginning of every lead story*

Track how leads enter your system:
- **source.submitted** - Raw lead received
- **source.accepted** - Passed validation
- **source.rejected** - Failed criteria

Key insights: Acceptance rates, rejection reasons, source quality

### üì§ [Recipient Events](./recipient-events)
*Where leads meet revenue*

Monitor delivery to buyers:
- **recipient.delivery_attempt** - Starting delivery
- **recipient.delivered** - Success confirmed
- **recipient.failed** - Delivery unsuccessful

Key insights: Delivery rates, buyer performance, failure patterns

### üö¶ [Filter Events](./filter-events)
*The routing decisions*

See how leads flow through logic:
- **filter.passed** - Criteria met
- **filter.failed** - Criteria not met

Key insights: Routing effectiveness, bottlenecks, flow optimization

### üîÑ [Feedback Events](./feedback-events)
*Closing the quality loop*

Track post-delivery outcomes:
- **feedback.received** - Buyer reported outcome
- **feedback.sent** - Quality update to source

Key insights: Conversion rates, quality scores, ROI tracking

### üîß [System Events](./system-events)
*Technical and operational events*

Monitor system operations:
- **enhancement.success** - Data appended
- **enhancement.failed** - Enhancement error
- **flow.completed** - Full journey done
- **error.occurred** - Technical issue

Key insights: Performance monitoring, error tracking, optimization opportunities

## Reading Event Timelines

### A Successful Lead Journey

```
10:30:45.123 ‚Üí source.submitted
10:30:45.234 ‚Üí source.accepted
10:30:45.345 ‚Üí filter.passed (Quality Check)
10:30:45.456 ‚Üí enhancement.success (Phone Validation)
10:30:45.567 ‚Üí filter.passed (High Value Router)
10:30:45.678 ‚Üí recipient.delivery_attempt
10:30:46.123 ‚Üí recipient.delivered
14:45:23.456 ‚Üí feedback.received (Converted!)
```

**What this tells you**: Fast processing (under 1 second), quality lead, successful delivery, and ultimate conversion.

### A Problematic Journey

```
10:30:45.123 ‚Üí source.submitted
10:30:45.234 ‚Üí source.accepted
10:30:45.345 ‚Üí filter.failed (Invalid Phone)
10:30:45.456 ‚Üí filter.passed (Backup Router)
10:30:45.567 ‚Üí recipient.delivery_attempt
10:30:75.567 ‚Üí recipient.failed (Timeout)
10:31:15.678 ‚Üí recipient.delivery_attempt (Retry)
10:31:16.123 ‚Üí recipient.delivered
11:45:00.000 ‚Üí feedback.received (Returned - Bad Phone)
```

**What this tells you**: Phone validation issue led to timeout, retry succeeded but lead was ultimately returned.

## Event Analysis Patterns

### Acceptance Rate Tracking

Monitor source quality:

```yaml
Source A Today:
  source.submitted: 1,000
  source.accepted: 920
  source.rejected: 80
  
Acceptance Rate: 92%
Rejection Reasons:
  - Invalid email: 30
  - Duplicate: 25
  - Under age: 25
```

### Delivery Performance

Track buyer reliability:

```yaml
Buyer X This Week:
  Attempts: 5,000
  Delivered: 4,750
  Failed: 250
  
Success Rate: 95%
Failure Breakdown:
  - Timeout: 150
  - Auth error: 50
  - Duplicate: 50
```

### Flow Efficiency

Measure processing speed:

```yaml
Average Times:
  Submission ‚Üí Acceptance: 120ms
  Acceptance ‚Üí Enhancement: 80ms
  Enhancement ‚Üí Delivery: 200ms
  Total: 400ms
  
Bottlenecks:
  - Enhancement step (if slow API)
  - Delivery retries (if buyer issues)
```
