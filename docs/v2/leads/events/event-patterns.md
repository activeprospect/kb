üöÄ **The outcome**: Data-driven insights that drive competitive advantage

## Event Aggregation Patterns

### Time-Based Aggregation

Roll up events by time period:

```yaml
Hourly Pattern Analysis:
  
Hour 09:00-10:00:
  Events: 12,453
  Accepted: 11,208 (90%)
  Delivered: 10,987 (98% of accepted)
  Failed: 221
  Feedback: 3,245
  
Insights:
  - Morning spike in volume
  - High quality (90% acceptance)
  - Excellent delivery (98%)
  - Fast feedback (30% same hour)
```

### Source Quality Scoring

Aggregate events by source:

```yaml
Source Scorecard (30 days):

Facebook Ads - Score: 92/100
  Submissions: 50,000
  Acceptance: 94%
  Delivery: 97%
  Contact Rate: 72%
  Conversion: 12%
  Returns: 2%
  
Google Ads - Score: 85/100
  Submissions: 35,000
  Acceptance: 88%
  Delivery: 95%
  Contact Rate: 68%
  Conversion: 10%
  Returns: 4%
```

### Buyer Performance Matrix

Multi-dimensional analysis:

```yaml
Buyer Performance Grid:
                 High Price    Med Price    Low Price
High Volume      Buyer A       Buyer D      Buyer G
                 95% dlv       92% dlv      90% dlv
                 $45 avg       $30 avg      $20 avg
                 
Med Volume       Buyer B       Buyer E      Buyer H
                 97% dlv       94% dlv      91% dlv
                 $48 avg       $32 avg      $22 avg
                 
Low Volume       Buyer C       Buyer F      Buyer I
                 99% dlv       96% dlv      93% dlv
                 $52 avg       $35 avg      $25 avg
```

## Complex Event Patterns

### The Retry Cascade

Understanding retry behavior:

```yaml
Initial Attempt ‚Üí Fail ‚Üí Retry Pattern:

Attempt 1 (0s):
  - 90% success
  - 10% fail
  
Attempt 2 (+30s):
  - 70% of failures succeed
  - 30% fail again
  
Attempt 3 (+90s):
  - 40% of remaining succeed
  - 60% permanent failure
  
Optimization:
  - 3 attempts optimal
  - Diminishing returns after
  - Different delays by error type
```

### The Quality Funnel

Track lead quality through events:

```yaml
Quality Degradation Pattern:

Source Quality:
  Hour 0-1: 95% valid data
  Hour 1-2: 93% valid
  Hour 2-4: 90% valid
  Hour 4-8: 85% valid
  Hour 8+: 80% valid
  
Action:
  - Prioritize fresh leads
  - Price by age
  - Set age limits
```

### The Feedback Loop

How feedback affects future events:

```yaml
Feedback Impact Chain:

High Returns from Source X
    ‚Üì
Tighten acceptance criteria
    ‚Üì
More source.rejected events
    ‚Üì
Higher quality accepted leads
    ‚Üì
Better delivery rates
    ‚Üì
Higher buyer satisfaction
    ‚Üì
Premium pricing unlocked
```

## Event-Driven Workflows

### Automated Quality Management

React to event patterns:

```yaml
Quality Automation Rules:

IF source rejection rate > 30% for 1 hour:
  ‚Üí Notify source manager
  ‚Üí Reduce volume cap by 50%
  ‚Üí Require manual review
  
IF buyer timeout rate > 10%:
  ‚Üí Increase timeout threshold
  ‚Üí Alert buyer technical contact
  ‚Üí Route to backup buyer
  
IF conversion feedback > 15%:
  ‚Üí Increase source cap
  ‚Üí Upgrade to premium tier
  ‚Üí Request more volume
```

### Dynamic Routing

Event-based decisions:

```yaml
Smart Routing Logic:

Check Recent Events:
  - Buyer A: 5 timeouts in last hour
  - Buyer B: All successful
  - Buyer C: Returning many leads
  
Routing Decision:
  - Skip Buyer A (temporary issue)
  - Prioritize Buyer B (performing well)
  - Reduce to Buyer C (quality concerns)
```

### Predictive Patterns

Use events to predict outcomes:

```yaml
Conversion Prediction Model:

Event Signals:
  - Fast acceptance (<100ms) ‚Üí +20% conversion
  - Multiple enhancements ‚Üí +15% conversion  
  - Delivered in <1s ‚Üí +10% conversion
  - Previous feedback positive ‚Üí +25% conversion
  
Routing Strategy:
  Score > 80% ‚Üí Premium exclusive buyer
  Score 60-80% ‚Üí Standard buyer pool
  Score < 60% ‚Üí Budget buyers only
```

## Performance Optimization

### Event Processing Speed

Handle high-volume events:

```yaml
Performance Benchmarks:

Event Capture: < 10ms
Event Storage: < 50ms
Event Query: < 100ms
Aggregation: < 500ms

At Scale (1M events/hour):
  - Capture: Distributed queue
  - Storage: Time-series DB
  - Query: Indexed lookups
  - Aggregation: Pre-computed
```

### Storage Strategies

Optimize event retention:

```yaml
Tiered Storage:

Hot (0-24 hours):
  - In-memory cache
  - Instant access
  - Full detail
  
Warm (1-30 days):
  - Fast SSD storage
  - Quick queries
  - Indexed access
  
Cold (30+ days):
  - Compressed archive
  - Batch access
  - Export only
```

### Query Optimization

Fast event analysis:

```yaml
Efficient Queries:

Instead of:
  SELECT * FROM events 
  WHERE timestamp > '30 days ago'
  
Use:
  - Pre-aggregated tables
  - Materialized views
  - Time-based partitions
  - Specific event types
```

## Advanced Analytics

### Cohort Analysis

Track groups over time:

```yaml
January Leads Cohort:

Day 1: 10,000 submitted
  - 9,000 accepted
  - 8,500 delivered
  
Day 7: Feedback received
  - 2,000 contacted
  - 500 interested
  
Day 30: Final outcomes
  - 200 converted
  - 2% conversion rate
  - $50 average value
  - $10,000 total revenue
```

### Attribution Modeling

Which events drive value:

```yaml
Revenue Attribution:

Enhancement Impact:
  With phone validation: 12% conversion
  Without: 8% conversion
  Lift: 50% improvement
  
Timing Impact:
  Delivered <1 min: 15% conversion
  Delivered 1-5 min: 10% conversion
  Delivered >5 min: 5% conversion
  
Source Quality:
  Premium sources: 18% conversion
  Standard sources: 10% conversion
  Budget sources: 5% conversion
```

### Anomaly Detection

Spot unusual patterns:

```yaml
Anomaly Rules:

Volume Anomalies:
  - Normal: 1,000 ¬±200 per hour
  - Alert: <600 or >1,400
  - Action: Investigate cause
  
Quality Anomalies:
  - Normal: 85-95% acceptance
  - Alert: <80% or >98%
  - Action: Check criteria/source
  
Performance Anomalies:
  - Normal: <1s processing
  - Alert: >3s average
  - Action: Check system health
```

## Event-Based Monitoring

### Real-Time Dashboards

Key event metrics:

```yaml
Operations Dashboard:

Current Hour:
  ‚ö° Events/sec: 127
  ‚úì Acceptance: 91%
  üì§ Delivery: 96%
  üí∞ Revenue: $4,231
  
Alerts:
  üî¥ Buyer X timeout spike
  üü° Source Y quality drop
  üü¢ All other systems normal
```

### Alert Strategies

Smart notifications:

```yaml
Alert Hierarchy:

Critical (Page immediately):
  - Delivery rate <80%
  - All buyers failing
  - Revenue stop
  
High (Notify in 5 min):
  - Source rejection >50%
  - Buyer degraded >10%
  - Error rate >5%
  
Medium (Email summary):
  - Quality trending down
  - Volume unusual
  - Feedback delays
```

### Health Scoring

System-wide view:

```yaml
System Health Score: 94/100

Components:
  Event Capture: 100% ‚úì
  Processing Speed: 98% ‚úì
  Delivery Success: 95% ‚úì
  Error Rate: 0.5% ‚úì
  Feedback Flow: 88% ‚ö†Ô∏è
  
Action Items:
  - Investigate feedback delays
  - All other systems healthy
```

## Event Data Management

### Retention Policies

Balance cost and value:

```yaml
Retention Strategy:

Immediate (Real-time):
  - All events
  - Full detail
  - Instant access
  
Short-term (30 days):
  - All events
  - Queryable
  - API access
  
Long-term (1 year):
  - Aggregated data
  - Key events only
  - Export access
  
Archive (7 years):
  - Compliance events
  - Compressed
  - Restore on request
```

### Privacy Considerations

Protect sensitive data:

```yaml
PII in Events:

Masking Rules:
  - Email: j***@example.com
  - Phone: XXX-XXX-4567
  - SSN: XXX-XX-6789
  - Name: John D.
  
Access Controls:
  - Role-based viewing
  - Audit trail
  - Encryption at rest
  - Secure transmission
```

### Integration Patterns

Share events externally:

```yaml
Event Distribution:

Firehose ‚Üí Data Lake
  - All events streamed
  - Near real-time
  - Analytics ready
  
Webhooks ‚Üí Partners
  - Key events only
  - Filtered by criteria
  - Retry logic
  
API ‚Üí Applications
  - On-demand access
  - Historical queries
  - Aggregated data
```
