# System Events

## The Behind-the-Scenes Intelligence

System events capture the technical operations that happen during lead processing - enhancements that add value, errors that need attention, and flow completions that mark journey's end. While other events track business decisions, system events monitor the machinery that makes it all work.

üìç **You are here**: Understanding technical and operational event tracking
üîß **What you'll learn**: Enhancement tracking, error handling, and system monitoring
üìà **The outcome**: Operational excellence through technical visibility

## Understanding System Events

### Categories of System Events

System events cover:
- **Enhancement Operations** - Data append success/failure
- **Flow Lifecycle** - Journey completion tracking
- **Error Conditions** - Technical issues and failures
- **System Health** - Performance and capacity

### Why System Events Matter

They reveal:
- Which enhancements provide value
- Where technical issues occur
- How efficiently flows process
- When systems need attention

## Enhancement Events

### Enhancement.Success

When data append works:

```json
{
  "event_type": "enhancement.success",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.456Z",
  "lead_id": "lead_7K9mHpQR3x2B5N8j",
  "enhancement": {
    "step_id": "step_9K3nL5mP2Q8wR4xB",
    "name": "Phone Intelligence",
    "service": "TrueCaller ID",
    "position": 2
  },
  "outcome": "success",
  "duration_ms": 234,
  "data_appended": {
    "phone_type": "mobile",
    "carrier": "Verizon",
    "risk_score": 15,
    "line_status": "active",
    "is_wireless": true
  },
  "cost": 0.02,
  "cache_hit": false,
  "metadata": {
    "api_version": "2.1",
    "response_size": 1024,
