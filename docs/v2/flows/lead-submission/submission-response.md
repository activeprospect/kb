# Submission Response

## Closing the Communication Loop

Submission responses are how LeadConduit talks back to your sources. They're the difference between sources blindly sending leads into a black hole versus getting clear, actionable feedback that helps them improve quality and optimize their operations. Think of responses as your automated account manager - always providing consistent, helpful feedback.

üìç **You are here**: Configuring how sources receive submission feedback
üí¨ **What you'll master**: Response formats, status codes, and helpful messaging
üéØ **The outcome**: Sources that improve quality and reduce disputes

## Understanding Submission Responses

### What Is a Submission Response?

After a source submits a lead, LeadConduit sends back:
- Success or failure status
- Specific acceptance/rejection reasons  
- Lead ID for tracking
- Additional metadata (price, warnings, etc.)

This happens in real-time, typically within 200-500ms of submission.

### Why Responses Matter

**For Sources**:
- Know immediately if leads are accepted
- Understand why leads are rejected
- Track their leads in your system
- Optimize their data quality

**For You**:
- Reduce support inquiries
- Improve source quality
- Minimize disputes
- Build better partnerships

**Real Impact**: One lead buyer reduced vendor support tickets by 75% by improving their rejection messages.

## Response Components

### HTTP Status Codes

Use standard codes to indicate result:

**Success Codes**:
```yaml
201 Created: Lead accepted and created
200 OK: Lead accepted (update)
202 Accepted: Lead queued for processing
```

**Client Error Codes**:
```yaml
400 Bad Request: Invalid data format
401 Unauthorized: Authentication failed
402 Payment Required: Account suspended
409 Conflict: Duplicate lead
422 Unprocessable Entity: Failed validation
429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded
```

**Server Error Codes**:
```yaml
500 Internal Server Error: System failure
503 Service Unavailable: Maintenance mode
504 Gateway Timeout: Processing timeout
```

### Response Body Structure

Provide detailed information:

**Successful Acceptance**:
```json
{
  "result": "success",
  "lead_id": "ABC123DEF456",
  "price": 25.00,
  "message": "Lead accepted successfully",
  "warnings": [],
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.123Z"
}
```

**Rejection with Details**:
```json
{
  "result": "failure",
  "reason": "Failed acceptance criteria",
  "errors": {
    "phone_1": "Invalid format - must be 10 digits",
    "email": "Disposable email domain not accepted",
    "state": "We do not accept leads from Alaska"
  },
  "lead_id": "TEMP789GHI012",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:45.456Z"
}
```

**Rate Limit Response**:
```json
{
  "result": "error",
  "reason": "Rate limit exceeded",
  "details": {
    "limit": "100 per minute",
    "current": "107",
    "reset_at": "2024-01-15T10:31:00Z"
  },
  "retry_after": 15
}
```

## Configuring Response Formats

### Standard Response Templates

LeadConduit provides customizable templates:

**Success Template**:
```handlebars
{
  "result": "success",
  "lead_id": "{{lead.id}}",
  "price": {{lead.cost}},
  "external_id": "{{lead.source_id}}",
  "created_at": "{{lead.timestamp}}",
  "message": "Lead accepted and processing"
}
```

**Failure Template**:
```handlebars
{
  "result": "failure", 
  "reason": "{{lead.rejection_reason}}",
  "errors": {{json lead.validation_errors}},
  "fields_received": {{json lead.fields}},
  "help_url": "https://docs.yourcompany.com/rejections"
}
```

### Custom Response Formats

Match source expectations:

**XML Response**:
```xml
<response>
  <result>{{lead.outcome}}</result>
  <leadId>{{lead.id}}</leadId>
  <price>{{lead.cost}}</price>
  <message>{{lead.outcome_message}}</message>
</response>
```

**Plain Text Response**:
```
RESULT: {{uppercase lead.outcome}}
ID: {{lead.id}}
PRICE: ${{lead.cost}}
{{#if lead.rejected}}
REASON: {{lead.rejection_reason}}
{{/if}}
```

**Custom JSON Structure**:
```json
{
  "status": {{#compare lead.outcome "success"}}1{{else}}0{{/compare}},
  "data": {
    "reference": "{{lead.id}}",
    "amount": {{lead.cost}},
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "meta": {
    "processed_at": "{{now}}",
    "processing_time_ms": {{lead.duration_ms}}
  }
}
```

## Rejection Messaging

### Clear Rejection Reasons

Help sources understand and fix issues:

**Vague (Bad)**:
```json
{
  "result": "failure",
  "reason": "Invalid data"
}
```

**Specific (Good)**:
```json
{
  "result": "failure",
  "reason": "Failed validation on 2 fields",
  "errors": {
    "phone_1": "Invalid format - received '555-CALL-NOW', expected 10 digits",
    "email": "Missing required field"
  }
}
```

**Helpful (Best)**:
```json
{
  "result": "failure",
  "reason": "Failed validation on 2 fields",
  "errors": {
    "phone_1": {
      "message": "Invalid phone format",
      "received": "555-CALL-NOW",
      "expected": "10-digit US phone number",
      "example": "5551234567",
      "help": "https://docs.site.com/phone-format"
    },
    "email": {
      "message": "Email required but not provided",
      "help": "https://docs.site.com/required-fields"
    }
  }
}
```

### Categorized Rejections

Group rejections logically:

**By Type**:
```json
{
  "result": "failure",
  "category": "data_quality",
  "subcategory": "invalid_format",
  "errors": {
    "field_errors": {
      "phone": "Invalid format",
      "email": "Invalid domain"
    }
  }
}
```

**By Severity**:
```json
{
  "result": "failure",
  "fatal_errors": {
    "email": "Required field missing"
  },
  "warnings": {
    "phone_2": "Secondary phone invalid but not required"
  },
  "suggestions": {
    "state": "California leads perform better than Nevada"
  }
}
```

## Advanced Response Features

### Conditional Responses

Different responses for different scenarios:

**Based on Source Type**:
```handlebars
{{#compare source.type "premium"}}
  {
    "result": "{{lead.outcome}}",
    "lead_id": "{{lead.id}}",
    "price": {{lead.cost}},
    "exclusive_until": "{{add_hours lead.timestamp 24}}",
    "quality_score": {{lead.score}}
  }
{{else}}
  {
    "result": "{{lead.outcome}}",
    "lead_id": "{{lead.id}}"
  }
{{/compare}}
```

**Based on Outcome**:
```handlebars
{{#compare lead.outcome "success"}}
  {{> success_response}}
{{else compare lead.rejection_reason "duplicate"}}
  {{> duplicate_response}}
{{else compare lead.rejection_reason "cap_exceeded"}}
  {{> cap_exceeded_response}}
{{else}}
