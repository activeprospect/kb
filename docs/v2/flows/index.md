# Flows

## Your Lead Processing Command Centers

Flows are where your business logic comes to life. They're visual pipelines that show exactly how leads move through your system - from initial submission through validation, enhancement, and delivery. If LeadConduit is your lead operations platform, flows are the assembly lines that do the actual work.

üìç **You are here**: Understanding the heart of LeadConduit
üéØ **What you'll learn**: How flows work and how to build them effectively
‚ö° **Power level**: From simple validations to complex multi-buyer routing

## What Makes a Flow?

Think of a flow like a smart conveyor belt in a factory:

```
Lead arrives ‚Üí Quality Check ‚Üí Enhancement ‚Üí Packaging ‚Üí Delivery
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì             ‚Üì            ‚Üì           ‚Üì
  Source      Validation    Add data    Format     Recipient
```

Each station (step) performs specific work. Bad products (leads) get rejected. Good ones continue to the next station. The whole line runs automatically, 24/7.

## The Anatomy of a Flow

Every flow has five key phases:

### 1. Lead Submission
Where leads enter your system:
- **[Sources](/flows/lead-submission/sources)** - Connection points for incoming leads
- **[Mappings](/flows/lead-submission/mappings)** - Transform vendor fields to your standards
- **[Acceptance Criteria](/flows/lead-submission/acceptance-criteria)** - Define quality gates
- **[Volume Caps](/flows/lead-submission/volume-caps)** - Control lead flow
- **[Pricing](/flows/lead-submission/pricing)** - Track costs automatically

### 2. Flow Steps
Where processing happens:
- **[Overview](/flows/flow-steps)** - Understanding step types
- **[Filter Steps](/flows/flow-steps/filter-steps)** - Route and validate
- **[Enhancement Steps](/flows/flow-steps/enhancement)** - Add valuable data
- **[Recipient Steps](/flows/flow-steps/recipient-steps)** - Deliver to buyers

### 3. Lead Events
Complete visibility into everything:
- **[Event Types](/leads/lead-events)** - What gets tracked
- **[Event Timeline](/leads/lead-events/timeline)** - See the journey
- **[Debugging with Events](/leads/lead-events/debugging)** - Fix issues fast

### 4. Reporting & Analytics
Turn data into insights:
- **[Flow Performance](/reporting/flow-analytics)** - Key metrics
- **[Source Analysis](/reporting/source-performance)** - Vendor quality
- **[Financial Tracking](/reporting/financial)** - ROI visibility

### 5. Optimization
Continuous improvement:
- **[A/B Testing](/flows/optimization/testing)** - Data-driven decisions
- **[Performance Tuning](/flows/optimization/performance)** - Speed matters
- **[Advanced Patterns](/flows/optimization/patterns)** - Pro techniques

## Core Flow Concepts

### Linear Processing
Flows process leads step-by-step, left to right:
- Each step completes before the next begins
- Steps can pass, fail, or error
- Failed steps might stop processing or just log the failure
- Errors can trigger retries

### Real-Time Execution
Most flows complete in under a second:
- Parse and validate: ~50ms
- Check duplicates: ~100ms
- Enhance data: ~200-500ms
- Deliver to CRM: ~200ms
- Total: Under 1 second

### Conditional Logic
Steps can include rules that control execution:
- Skip expensive enhancements for low-value leads
- Route to different buyers based on criteria
- Apply different validations by source
- Time-based processing rules

## Common Flow Patterns

### Basic Validation Flow
The simplest useful flow:
```
Source ‚Üí Validate Email ‚Üí Check Duplicates ‚Üí Deliver
```
Perfect for: Testing, simple lead collection, basic quality control

### Enhanced Lead Flow
Add valuable data:
```
Source ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí TrustedForm ‚Üí Phone Lookup ‚Üí Score ‚Üí Deliver
```
Perfect for: Compliance-focused buyers, quality-driven operations

### Multi-Buyer Distribution
Maximize revenue per lead:
```
Source ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Buyer A (exclusive)
                  ‚Üò Buyer B (if A rejects)
                  ‚Üò Buyer C, D, E (shared)
```
Perfect for: Lead sellers, networks, aggregators

### Ping/Post Flow
Real-time bidding:
```
Ping ‚Üí Send to buyers ‚Üí Collect bids ‚Üí Accept highest
Post ‚Üí Deliver to winner ‚Üí Confirm ‚Üí Fallback if needed
```
Perfect for: Maximum revenue, competitive markets

## Building Effective Flows

### Start Simple
1. **Basic flow first** - Source ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Deliver
2. **Test thoroughly** - Submit test leads, verify outcomes
3. **Add complexity gradually** - One step at a time
4. **Monitor performance** - Watch metrics improve

### Design Principles

**Fail Fast**
- Put likely rejections early
- Validate before enhancing
- Check caps before processing

**Enhance Wisely**
- Only add data you'll use
- Consider enhancement costs
- Cache when possible

**Deliver Reliably**
- Always configure retries
- Have fallback options
- Monitor delivery rates

### Performance Optimization

**For Speed**:
- Minimize enhancement calls
- Use efficient filters first
- Parallel delivery when possible

**For Quality**:
- Layer validations progressively
- Use type-specific validators
- Implement feedback loops

**For Scale**:
- Design for concurrent processing
- Implement smart capping
- Monitor resource usage

## Flow Management

### Development Lifecycle
1. **Design** - Map out requirements
2. **Build** - Create in staging
3. **Test** - Verify all paths
4. **Deploy** - Move to production
5. **Monitor** - Track performance
6. **Optimize** - Continuous improvement

### Version Control
- Flows auto-save changes
- Full audit trail available
- Can revert if needed
- Test changes safely

### Access Control
- View permissions by role
- Edit permissions by flow
- Separate staging/production
- Audit all changes

## Troubleshooting Flows

### Common Issues

**Leads Rejecting**
1. Check acceptance criteria
2. Review rejection reasons
3. Verify field mappings
4. Test with sample data

**Slow Processing**
1. Identify bottleneck steps
2. Optimize enhancement calls
3. Review step ordering
4. Consider caching

**Delivery Failures**
1. Verify recipient configuration
2. Check authentication
3. Review response parsing
4. Implement retries

### Using Events for Debugging
Every lead creates detailed events:
- See exact data at each step
- Understand why steps failed
- Track timing for each operation
- Identify patterns in failures

## Advanced Flow Features

### Sub-Flows
Reuse common logic:
- Standard validation sub-flow
- Compliance checking sub-flow
- Enhancement bundle sub-flow

### Dynamic Routing
Route based on real-time conditions:
- Buyer capacity
- Time of day
- Lead score
- Previous outcomes

### Custom Integrations
Extend with your own logic:
- Custom scoring algorithms
- Proprietary data sources
- Internal systems
- Business-specific rules
