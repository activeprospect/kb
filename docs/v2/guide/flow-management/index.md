## 📊 By Use Case

### For Lead Buyers
- Start with [Acceptance Criteria](./acceptance-criteria.md) to enforce quality
- Configure [Volume Caps](./volume-caps.md) to control spend
- Master [Multi-Buyer Distribution](./multi-buyer-distribution.md) for complex scenarios

### For Lead Sellers  
- Focus on [Working with Steps](./working-with-steps.md) for delivery
- Learn [Filter Routing](./filter-routing.md) for buyer requirements
- Understand [Pricing Strategies](./pricing-strategies.md) for revenue optimization

### For Flow Optimization
- Begin with [Performance Optimization](./performance-optimization.md)
- Use [Disabling Steps](./disabling-steps.md) for testing
- Implement [Service Area Routing](./service-area-routing.md) for efficiency

## 💡 Pro Tips

**Start with Simple Flows**: Master basic linear flows before attempting complex routing. You can always add sophistication later.

**Test Incrementally**: Add one step at a time and test. It's easier to identify issues in simple configurations.

**Use Clear Naming**: "California Solar Buyer - Priority" beats "Destination 1" every time.

**Monitor Performance**: Check your flow's average processing time regularly. Under 500ms is good, under 300ms is great.

## 🎯 Common Patterns

### The Quality Gate Pattern
1. Acceptance Criteria (basic validation)
2. Enhancement (phone/email verification)
3. Filter (quality score threshold)
4. Destination (only quality leads delivered)

### The Multi-Tier Distribution Pattern
1. Filter: Premium leads (score > 80)
   → Premium Buyer (exclusive)
2. Filter: Standard leads (score 60-80)
   → Standard Buyer Pool
3. All others → Backup Buyer

### The Compliance-First Pattern
1. TrustedForm validation
2. Suppression list check
3. State compliance filter
4. Then normal distribution
