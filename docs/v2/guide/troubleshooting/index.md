## üö® Emergency Checklist

When everything seems broken:

1. **Check System Status**
   - Look for platform announcements
   - Verify external services are up

2. **Review Recent Changes**
   - What was modified in last 24 hours?
   - Did any integrations change?

3. **Check Events**
   - Find a failed lead in Events
   - Trace through each step
   - Look for error messages

4. **Test with Simple Data**
   - Create minimal test lead
   - Remove optional fields
   - Isolate the problem

5. **Contact Support**
   - Email: support@activeprospect.com
   - Include flow ID and event IDs
   - Describe what changed

## üí° Troubleshooting Principles

**Start with Events**: Events tell you exactly what happened. Always check there first.

**Isolate Variables**: Change one thing at a time when debugging.

**Test with Known Good Data**: Use data that previously worked to identify what changed.

**Check the Obvious**: Is the flow active? Are credentials valid? Did something expire?

**Document Solutions**: When you fix something, write down what worked for next time.

## üîç Quick Diagnosis Guide

### Symptom: No leads coming through
- Check: Source is active?
- Check: Authentication working?
- Check: Vendor sending to correct URL?

### Symptom: All leads rejected
- Check: Acceptance criteria too strict?
- Check: Required fields being sent?
- Check: Field mappings correct?

### Symptom: Delivery failing
- Check: Destination credentials valid?
- Check: Required fields mapped?
- Check: Destination system accepting data?

### Symptom: Slow processing
- Check: Enhancement timeouts?
- Check: Complex rules?
- Check: Large field data?
