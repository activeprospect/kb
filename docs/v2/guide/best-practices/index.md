## ðŸ’¡ Universal Best Practices

**Start Simple, Scale Smart**: Begin with basic flows and add complexity as needed.

**Measure Everything**: You can't optimize what you don't measure.

**Document Decisions**: Future you will thank current you for clear documentation.

**Test Before Scaling**: Validate patterns with small volumes before going big.

**Automate Repetitive Tasks**: If you do it twice, consider automating it.

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Principles

### The 80/20 Rule
- 80% of your leads will follow standard patterns
- 20% will need special handling
- Design for the 80%, accommodate the 20%

### Fail Fast, Recover Faster
- Reject bad leads early in the flow
- Have clear error messages
- Build in retry logic for transient failures

### Trust but Verify
- Trust your vendors but validate their data
- Trust your systems but monitor performance
- Trust your rules but review outcomes
