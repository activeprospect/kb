### Mapping Template Technique

When configuring multiple mappings with the same pattern, use the template approach:

#### The Problem
Creating 20 similar mappings one at a time is tedious and error-prone.

#### The Solution

1. **Create Your Template Mapping**
   - Add your first mapping
   - Select the mapping type (e.g., "JSON Property", "Form Field", "Text Template")
   - Leave the values empty - this is your template

2. **Replicate the Template**
   - Click the **"copy this mapping"** icon
   - This creates an exact duplicate with the same configuration
   - Repeat for as many mappings as needed

3. **Fill in the Values**
   - Now you have multiple mappings with consistent configuration
   - Simply fill in the specific field values
   - No need to reconfigure the mapping type each time

#### When to Use This

This technique shines when:
- Setting up recipient configurations with many fields
- Creating consistent JSON property mappings
- Building form field mappings with similar patterns
- Configuring enhancement response mappings

üí° **Time Saved**: 2-3 seconds per field √ó 20 fields = 1 minute saved per configuration

### Bulk Rule Creation

When creating multiple similar rules:

1. **Create Base Rule**
   - Build your first rule completely
   - Test it to ensure it works

2. **Duplicate and Modify**
   - Use browser developer tools to copy rule HTML
   - Paste and modify values
   - Much faster than clicking through UI repeatedly

### Flow Template Library

Build a library of template flows:

1. **Create Base Flows**
   - "Basic Lead Validation"
   - "Standard CRM Delivery"
   - "Compliance-First Pattern"

2. **Clone for New Projects**
   - Start from proven template
   - Modify only what's different
   - Maintain consistency across flows

## üöÄ Advanced Efficiency Techniques

### Smart Field Naming

Use consistent field naming patterns:

```
Source Fields:
- src_phone
- src_email
- src_campaign_id

Validated Fields:
- valid_phone
- valid_email

Enhanced Fields:
- enhanced_score
- enhanced_demographic
```

Benefits:
- Easy to identify field purpose
- Simpler mapping configuration
- Clear data lineage

### Step Organization Patterns

Organize steps for maximum clarity:

```
1. [VALIDATE] Check Required Fields
2. [VALIDATE] TrustedForm Verification
3. [ENHANCE] Phone Validation
4. [ENHANCE] Email Hygiene
5. [ROUTE] Premium Leads
6. [ROUTE] Standard Leads
7. [DELIVER] CRM
8. [DELIVER] Email Notification
```

Use prefixes to group related steps visually.

### Acceptance Criteria Optimization

Structure rules for performance:

1. **Fastest Checks First**
   - Required field checks (instant)
   - Type validation checks (fast)
   - External service checks (slower)

2. **Most Likely Failures First**
   - Check the rule that rejects 50% of leads before the one that rejects 1%
   - Reduces average processing time

3. **Group Related Rules**
   ```
   === REQUIRED FIELDS ===
   email is not blank
   phone is not blank
   
   === GEOGRAPHIC ===
   state is one of [CA, TX, FL]
   zip is valid
   
   === COMPLIANCE ===
   trustedform_url is not blank
   tcpa_consent is true
   ```

## üí° Configuration Shortcuts

### Keyboard Navigation

Master these keyboard shortcuts:
- `Tab` - Move between fields
- `Enter` - Save and continue
- `Esc` - Cancel current dialog
- `Ctrl/Cmd + S` - Save flow

### URL Hacks

Bookmark these patterns:
- `/flows/{id}/edit` - Direct to flow editor
- `/flows/{id}/events` - Jump to events
- `/flows/{id}/stats` - Quick stats view

### Browser Tools

Use browser features effectively:
- **Bookmarklets** for common actions
- **Password manager** for test credentials
- **Developer tools** for bulk operations

## üéØ Testing Efficiency

### Test Data Templates

Create reusable test data sets:

```json
// minimal-valid.json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "phone": "555-123-4567"
}

// full-enhanced.json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "phone": "555-123-4567",
  "first_name": "Test",
  "last_name": "User",
  "state": "CA",
  "zip": "90210",
  // ... all fields
}
```

### Batch Testing

Test multiple scenarios efficiently:
1. Create test script with all variations
2. Run through command line
3. Review results in bulk

### Quick Validation

For rapid testing:
1. Temporarily disable non-critical steps
2. Test core functionality
3. Re-enable all steps
4. Run full test suite
