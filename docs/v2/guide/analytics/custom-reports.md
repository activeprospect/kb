# Building Custom Reports

Create reports that answer your specific business questions. Learn to build, customize, and share reports that provide actionable insights into your lead operations.

## üìç You Are Here

You're learning to build custom reports that go beyond standard metrics. Whether tracking vendor performance, monitoring costs, or analyzing conversion patterns, custom reports give you the exact data you need.

## üéØ What You'll Master

- Creating and configuring reports
- Adding columns, filters, and groupings
- Time range selection and scheduling
- Sharing and exporting reports
- Common report patterns

## üöÄ Creating Your First Report

### Step 1: Navigate to Reporting

1. Click **Reporting** in the main navigation
2. Click **Create New Report** (upper-right)
3. A new report opens in edit mode

### Step 2: Name Your Report

1. Click the pencil icon next to "Editing Report"
2. Enter a descriptive name:
   - ‚ùå "New Report - 2024-01-15"
   - ‚úÖ "Daily Vendor Performance"
   - ‚úÖ "Monthly Cost Analysis by State"

### Step 3: Configure Basic Settings

- **Date Range**: Select preset or custom range
- **Time Zone**: Ensure matches your business hours
- **Auto-refresh**: Enable for real-time dashboards

## üèóÔ∏è Building Report Structure

### Adding Columns

Columns define what data appears in your report:

1. **Click "Add Column"**
2. **Choose Column Type**:
   - **Dimension**: Grouping data (Source, State, Outcome)
   - **Measure**: Numeric data (Count, Sum, Average)
   - **Calculated**: Custom formulas

3. **Configure the Column**:
   ```
   Column: Lead Count
   Type: Measure
   Aggregation: Count
   Field: Event ID
   ```

### Essential Column Types

**Dimensions** (for grouping):
- Source Name
- Flow Name
- Outcome (Success/Failure)
- Rejection Reason
- State/Geography
- Time periods (Hour, Day, Week)

**Measures** (for metrics):
- Lead Count
- Success Rate
- Average Price
- Total Revenue
- Processing Time

### Column Configuration Examples

**Acceptance Rate Column**:
```
Name: Acceptance Rate
Type: Calculated
Formula: (Success Count / Total Count) * 100
Format: Percentage
```

**Revenue Column**:
```
Name: Total Revenue
Type: Measure
Field: Sale Price
Aggregation: Sum
Format: Currency
```

## üîç Adding Filters

Filters narrow your data to specific criteria:

### Basic Filters

1. Click **Add Filter**
2. Select field to filter
3. Choose operator
4. Enter value(s)

**Examples**:
```
Flow equals "Insurance Leads"
Date is within Last 7 days
Outcome equals "Success"
State is one of ["CA", "TX", "FL"]
```

### Advanced Filter Patterns

**Time-based Filtering**:
```
Hour of Day is between 9 and 17
Day of Week is not "Saturday" or "Sunday"
Created Date is after "2024-01-01"
```

**Performance Filtering**:
```
Acceptance Rate is less than 50%
Processing Time is greater than 1000ms
Price is between 5 and 50
```

### Filter Logic

Combine filters with AND/OR logic:
```
(Flow equals "Solar Leads" AND State equals "CA")
OR
(Flow equals "Insurance" AND Source contains "Facebook")
```

## üìä Grouping Data

Groupings organize your data hierarchically:

### Single-Level Grouping

Group by one dimension:
```
Group By: Source
Shows: Performance metrics for each source
```

### Multi-Level Grouping

Create hierarchical views:
```
Primary Group: State
Secondary Group: Source
Shows: Sources broken down by state
```

### Time-Based Grouping

Track trends over time:
```
Group By: Date (Day)
Shows: Daily performance trends

Group By: Hour of Day
Shows: Intraday patterns
```

### Grouping Best Practices

- **Start broad**: Group by major categories first
- **Add detail**: Use secondary groupings for granularity
- **Consider performance**: Too many groups slow reports
- **Use summaries**: Enable subtotals for groups

## üé® Common Report Patterns

IF(Phone Valid, 5, 0) + 
IF(Email Valid, 5, 0)
```

- User has permission to view data
- Events are being recorded

### "Calculations Wrong"

**Verify**:
- Formula syntax correct
- Using right fields
- Aggregation method appropriate
- Time zones aligned

## üìà Optimization Tips

### Performance

- **Index frequently filtered fields**
- **Limit columns** to what's needed
- **Pre-aggregate** when possible
- **Cache** for static reports

### Usability

- **Logical order**: Most important columns first
- **Consistent formatting**: Currencies, percentages
- **Helpful descriptions**: Add memo explaining metrics

### Maintenance

- **Review monthly**: Remove unused reports
- **Version control**: Copy before major changes
- **Document formulas**: Explain complex calculations
- **Share knowledge**: Train team on report usage
