# Welcome to LeadConduit

## Your Lead Operations Command Center

LeadConduit is a lead processing platform that transforms the chaotic world of multi-vendor lead operations into a streamlined, accountable, and profitable business process. Think of it as your intelligent command center that sits between lead sources and your sales systems, ensuring every lead you pay for meets your exact specifications while providing complete visibility into your entire operation.

At its core, LeadConduit solves the fundamental challenge every lead buyer faces: *"How do I ensure I'm only paying for leads that can actually convert?"* It's not just about moving data from point A to point B – it's about protecting your business, maximizing ROI, and giving you complete control over your lead acquisition strategy.

📍 **You are here**: The starting point of your journey from lead chaos to lead clarity. In the next 5 minutes, you'll understand exactly what LeadConduit does and why thousands of companies trust it with billions of leads.

## Why LeadConduit Exists

### The Problem We Solve

Imagine this: You're buying 10,000 leads per day from multiple sources. Some are gold, some are garbage. Without LeadConduit:
- **23% are duplicates or invalid** (that's $2,300 wasted daily at $1/lead)
- **Each source sends data differently** (your team spends hours normalizing)
- **Bad leads reach sales** (productivity tanks, morale drops)
- **Disputes are unwinnable** (no proof of what was actually sent)

Sound familiar? You're not alone.

### The Solution in Action

LeadConduit addresses these challenges through three core capabilities:

1. **Intelligent Flow Processing** - Your business logic without code
2. **Complete Event Visibility** - Every action tracked and auditable
3. **Standardized Integration** - Connect once, benefit forever

Let's see what this means in practice.

## Flows: Where Business Logic Comes Alive

A flow is where your entire lead buying operation becomes automated policy. Instead of manually checking each lead, your flow automatically:

- **Validates data quality** using intelligent type parsing
- **Enforces your acceptance criteria** through configurable rules
- **Checks compliance** via TrustedForm integration
- **Blocks duplicates** and suppressed contacts
- **Routes intelligently** to the right systems
- **Tracks every penny** of cost and revenue

### Real Users, Real Results

> "We went from processing 1,000 leads per day with a team of 3 to processing 50,000 leads per day with better quality. LeadConduit paid for itself in the first week." - Sarah, VP of Marketing at Insurance Leads Co.

This happens because flows turn your business rules into automated policy. No more manual checking, no more bad data reaching sales, no more vendor disputes.

## Events: Complete Visibility Into Everything

Every action in LeadConduit generates an event - a detailed, immutable record of exactly what happened. This isn't just logging; it's complete accountability.

### Real Example: The $12,000 Discovery

Mike from Solar Leads Inc. noticed something odd in his event data:
1. 40% of rejections came from one source
2. All failed on "invalid phone format"
3. The source was sending `+1 (555) 123-4567` instead of `5551234567`
4. A 2-minute field mapping fix saved $12,000/month

That's the power of visibility - problems become obvious, solutions become simple.

### What Events Enable

- **Vendor Accountability**: Indisputable proof of what was sent and why it was rejected
- **Operational Intelligence**: Spot patterns, identify bottlenecks, optimize flow
- **Compliance Documentation**: Complete audit trail for every lead
- **Dispute Resolution**: Show exactly what happened, when, and why

## Integration Without the Integration

Here's where LeadConduit flips the script on traditional lead distribution.

### Before and After

**Traditional Integration Hell:**
```
Week 1: Read vendor's API docs
Week 2: Implement OAuth2 handshake
Week 3: Parse their weird JSON format
Week 4: Handle their error codes
Week 5: Test and debug
Week 6: Finally receiving leads (maybe)
```

**LeadConduit Reality:**
```
Minute 1: Select vendor from list
Minute 2: Enter your credentials
Minute 3: Map their fields to yours
Minute 4: Receiving leads
Minute 5: Grab coffee, you're done
```

Major lead sources already have integrations built. You just configure and go.

## Intelligent Data Handling

### Types: Order from Chaos

Lead data arrives in countless formats:
- Phone: "(512) 789-1111" vs "512-789-1111" vs "5127891111"
- State: "TX" vs "Texas" vs "tx"
- Boolean: "yes" vs "y" vs "1" vs "true"

Types automatically parse any format into standardized components:
- Phone → number, area code, type (mobile/landline), carrier
- Email → address, domain, validity, free email status
- Dates → timestamp, age, day of week

### The Smart Separation

**Types handle structure**: "Is this a valid phone number?"
**Rules handle business logic**: "Do I accept landline numbers?"

This separation means:
- Parsing never breaks your flow
- Business rules are clearly visible
- Changes are easy to make
- Everyone understands what's happening
