# Source-Level Acceptance Criteria (Rule-Based)

Source-level acceptance criteria enable targeted lead filtering and qualification based on traffic source characteristics, performance history, and business requirements. These rule-based filters ensure optimal lead quality while supporting strategic source relationship management and revenue optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria Overview

### Purpose of Source-Level Filtering

**Quality Control by Source:**
- Apply different quality standards based on source performance
- Filter leads based on historical source quality and conversion data
- Implement source-specific qualification requirements
- Support tiered quality management across source portfolio

**Strategic Source Management:**
- Reward high-performing sources with preferential treatment
- Apply stricter criteria to underperforming or new sources
- Support source development and improvement initiatives
- Enable strategic partnership optimization

**Business Logic Implementation:**
- Apply business rules specific to traffic sources
- Implement source-based pricing and routing logic
- Support compliance requirements by source type
- Enable market-specific qualification criteria
