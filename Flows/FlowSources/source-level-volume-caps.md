- Prevent quality degradation from volume surges
- Maintain consistent lead quality standards
- Support quality-focused source development
- Enable quality-based capacity allocation

**System Performance:**
- Protect downstream systems from overload
- Maintain processing performance and reliability
- Support predictable capacity planning
- Enable efficient resource allocation

**Strategic Source Management:**
- Balance volume across diversified source portfolio
- Support new source development and testing
- Enable tiered source relationship management
- Optimize revenue through strategic volume allocation
