# Using Google Lead Forms to Generate Leads Directly from Google Ads

Google Ads has a feature called Google lead form extensions, an option for advertisers to generate leads directly from their ad campaigns. These lead forms can be created and attached to both new and existing campaigns, allowing prospects to submit their information directly from the ad. Lead form extensions can collect information from a lead form such as:

- Name (can be customized as ""First name and last name"" or ""Full name"")
- Email
- Phone number
- City
- Zip / Postal code
- State / Province
- Country
- Company name
- Job title
- Work email
- Work phone number

To retrieve your leads, you’ll have to manually download them as a batch file or configure a webhook to send out automatically which can be cumbersome. With LeadConduit, we have an integration with the Google lead form webhook that allows you to instantly connect and send leads in real-time to any system without the need of your IT department. When combined with the power of other LeadConduit integrations, this empowers you to validate, enhance, and deliver these leads with just a few clicks.

To use LeadConduit’s [Google lead form webhook integration](https://activeprospect.com/integrations/google-lead-forms/), open your flow editor and create a new source. You can give the source any label you choose, but be sure to select Google lead form webhook from the list of inbound integrations. Save your flow and copy the submission URL from the posting instructions of the newly created source. This submission URL is what you’ll use when configuring the lead form webhook.

# TrustedForm Glossary

TrustedForm terms and what they mean

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Claim or Retain \[a TrustedForm certificate\] | Claim, also called Retain, is the [action required to save a TrustedForm Certificate](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/getting-started-with-claiming/) (for a default 5 years) in your ActiveProspect account for later use. This action is taken by API or LeadConduit on the full certificate URL of 69 characters in the format https://cert.trustedform.com/<cert\_token>. |
| Extend \[a TrustedForm certificate\] | Managed customers can extend the Claim Window for a certificate to be claimed to 90 days [by API,](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v3.0/tag/TrustedForm-Certificate-Check-in/) or it may be done automatically [by Auto Extend.](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4488105-extended-retention-window-for-submitted-leads) The Extend API is available by special permission arranged by your AP team for managed customers. |

For example, a certificate that can be claimed for the next 12 weeks might display ""Unless claimed, this certificate will be deleted in: 12 weeks."" |
| Auto Extend | When a TrustedForm certificate is created, [if a submit event can be identified, the Claim/Delete window is automatically extended](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4488105-extended-retention-window-for-submitted-leads) to 90 days. |
| Auto Retain | [Register your web site so that](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4812756-trustedform-auto-retain-for-first-party-lead-certification) TrustedForm automatically claims/retains the TrustedForm Certificate to your ActiveProspect account. |
| TrustedForm Certify Web SDK | [The javascript snippet is embedded on a web site in order to generate the TrustedForm certificate](https://community.activeprospect.com/series/4190127-implementing-the-trustedform-script-in-a-form-page), which can be configured to your specifications in the _Certify screen_ of any TrustedForm account. |

| Fingerprints | When making a claim (i.e., retaining) a certificate,  the email and phone numbers included with a [lead will be hashed (encrypted) as ""fingerprints"" and checked against the email and phone recorded by TrustedForm during the consumer web session.](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4077176-lead-fingerprinting) |
| Page Scan | When making a claim (i.e., retaining) a certificate, [you can specify text that must be included](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4078890-page-scan), or must not be included, in the consumer session. |
| Event Log | On a tab of the TrustedForm Certificate, the Event Log [documents the consumer keystrokes, scrolling, and button presses](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4776894-trustedform-session-replay-enhancements). |

# TrustedForm Certify SDK: sending the TrustedForm Certificate URL with your lead

When implementing the TrustedForm Certify SDK, web site implementers have to include the TrustedForm Certificate URL value with the lead data.

Background: When added correctly, the TrustedForm javascript snippet (Certify Web SDK) will create a new, unique certificate each time a browser loads the page. Then, the web site will send the TrustedForm Certificate URL  along with the lead data as documentation of that consumer visit to the page.

By default, the javascript snippet--as initially presented on the Certify screen of the TrustedForm app-- records a full certificate URL starting with ""https://cert.trustedform.com/"" in the ""xxTrustedFormCertUrl"" field.

This is the value you'll need to send as a field in your lead when the consumer submits the form.

**But what if your web form doesn't automatically discover and send the xxTrustedFormCertUrl field?**

If you are using a site builder platform and your web form doesn't automatically discover the xxTrustedFormCertUrl field, you'll need to create a field for the certificate URL value. To set the value in your new field to what is generated in the TrustedForm javascript, first consult the documentation for your web site platform for any tips for including values from an external script.  Then, in light of what is suggested, you can also try these tips.

1\. Inspect your site for the field name for a field you've created, and change the TrustedForm javascript accordingly.  For example, let's say your web form package uses ""custom-field-25"" as the name of the new field you created; you'll want to substitute this name for ""xxTrustedFormCertUrl"" in the script. This instructs the script to write to the field you've created. You can do this under ""Script Configurations"" on the Certify screen:

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/936/940/original.png?f=1698037244&Expires=1748567781&Signature=Ncer1brfVU-7UWzqWZE17qQyhp195Jh9fINPSKaCZN67Wr4AUMcoC5fLJwbCZ9TsJI4LWoEoKhilYv01XGR73wa2QXcrxmpXGVGHhV6wdJIrpadjtrhFwbVRwlPue7fziGrn8v8taFg~0rZJKv3zpHp0jTPhgDck3RROKNSyR~gLQDlPGrQwxbV3-z23naErONlkIVFJS~4yLMck66qmyhfKSMoK7oX6qE2acMuiwN2L2n3cniHZK945IW8Y1~iv9HY9Kr6299Zjq-ar4wJCnxyJjJEGJygsePioVmgv66BpRgleWuZPyz2p17286Kg4BMS3AkCnuBH~V~QHyqs1kQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

2\.  TrustedForm provides a callback function that can be used to return the TrustedForm Certificate URL value. Please see the [documentation giving an example of the callback function](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4076703-callback-function-after-the-certificate-is-inserted-into-your-form) for more information. Many platforms today such as React sites will require this function in order to discover the TrustedForm Certificate URL.

# Will the TrustedForm JavaScript slow down my site?

No, for several reasons:

- The script is designed to operate in the background. If properly installed it will not begin communicating with the TrustedForm service before the page has loaded.
- Initial and ongoing communications between the browser and TrustedForm are very lightweight, occur in the background, consume very little network bandwidth and almost no user CPU/memory load.
- The transmission of user actions between the browser and TrustedForm occurs only after the user action has occurred. During the user action there is no TrustedForm activity or load.
- TrustedForm retrieves remotely-hosted page assets independently, not via the user's machine, and begins that process after the form has been submitted.

# Using Boolean operators

The knowledge base search engine uses a default operator of OR instead of AND. For example, if you enter ""TrustedForm Sandbox Mode"" as your search query, it searches for contributions that contain ""TrustedForm"" OR ""Sandbox"" OR ""Mode"" and your search results will therefore show contributions that contain any of those words. You can use Boolean operators in your query to make the results of your search more specific.

The following Boolean operators are supported.

- \+ to use AND operation (example: coffee + tea)
- “ “ to search for a phrase (example: ""cat coffee mug"")
- \| for an OR operation (example: coffee \| tea)
- \- for removing a term from your search; spaces must be included on either side of the dash in order for this to work (example: coffee - decaf)
- ( ) to group terms logically (example: (strong +coffee) \| (green +tea))

# Introducing TrustedForm Certificate API v4.0

TrustedForm Certificate API v4.0 is the latest and recommended version when using the TrustedForm product offering. As part of this release we are highlighting changes below that are relevant to our community to help you understand what's new and update your integrations with our platform.

For full details please visit our [developer portal](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Certificate-URL/).

Are you a self-service customer? [View How to use API version 4.0](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5098113-trustedform-self-service-how-to-use-api-version-4-0/)

# General Announcement and Updates

New Product: TrustedForm Retain

[TrustedForm Retain](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4986362-trustedform-retain) is the newest product to join the TrustedForm product offering. It is a streamlined version of past products, TrustedForm Claim and TrustedForm Consent, used to store TrustedForm certificates in your account. Enjoy the latest version of our session replay technology with advanced navigation controls and more prominent placement of the most useful data to audit your certificates. This also includes several bug fixes to ensure that each certificate is the most accurate representation of the lead events captured within them and protection against incurring charges for repeated attempts to store a single certificate. If you become a managed customer and [verify ownership of your domains](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4649879-verify-domain-ownership) you can unlock special discounts for your first party leads.

Lead Matching

As published in the ActiveProspect blog, starting July 5th TrustedForm with enforce a [new data security enhancement which limits access to TrustedForm Certificate session replays](https://activeprospect.com/blog/trustedform-new-data-security-enhancement/) to parties who already have access to the consumer data contained within them. Due to this, the new API version requires [lead matching](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4766190-trustedform-lead-matching) to be performed when storing a certificate. This ensures that all parties involved in the lead generation process are better protected.

Page Scanning

The [page scan feature](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4078890-trustedform-page-scan) has historically be available in every API based product TrustedForm has offer. Searching for specific text can be a great way to learn more how a lead was generated and gauge its quality. As such, it is most aligned to the TrustedForm Insights product and will now exclusively be available as a part of it.

# Breaking Changes

Operations

TrustedForm Certificate API v4.0 introduces the concepts of operations. Operations are the actions that can be performed via the TrustedForm Certificate API. In order to use the API you must now include the operations you would like to run in your request. This allows you to specify exactly which operations you want to perform so that you can use them in isolation (ex. store a certificate without retrieving insights) or create whatever combination of operations you need. Most operations align with TrustedForm products so it was important for us to give you full control over when they are performed rather than bundling them together. This allows you to better manage your usage and the costs incurred.

Insights Data Points

Many customers don't yet need all of the data points available in the [TrustedForm Insights](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4709758-trustedform-insights) product and don't want to manage data they aren't using. In order to accommodate this we have changed the structure of requests for insights to require that you pass the specific data points you would like to be returned in the response. This ensures that you get exactly what you want and can follow [data minimization](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/Data-Minimization) principles.

API Schema

With TrustedForm Certificate API v4.0 comes an entirely new API schema. This mostly changes how properties are organized to make it more readable and easier to understand. In order to adopt this new schema you must create completely new parsing logic as the changes are too drastic to simply modify any former logic. Please view the new schema in the [full API documentation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/overview/).

# Deprecations

Programatic Retrieval of Share URLs

The Share URL response property was deprecated in TrustedForm Certificate API v3.0, but it is important to highlight this again as v2.0 is still in use. Share URLs are special URLs that allow anyone to view a TrustedForm certificate without authenticating within the TrustedForm application. These are very convenient to use when responding to demand letters or as evidence during litigation. We found that returning these URLs in the API response was a cavalier decision due to the sensitive nature of TrustedForm certificates. Therefore we have decided to stop this and only allow Share URLs to be retrieved when viewing a TrustedForm certificate to encourage more secure practices.

The following will be sunset in the near future:

- [TrustedForm Certificate API v2.0](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v2.0/overview/#section/Overview)
- [TrustedForm Certificate API v3.0](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v3.0/overview/#section/Overview)
- TrustedForm Claim
- TrustedForm Ping API
- TrustedForm Consent

# Connecting Constant Contact

First, you'll need a Constant Contact **API Key**. Their developer site has extensive instructions for how to [get started with the Constant Contact API (and get an API key)](https://developer.constantcontact.com/api_guide/getting_started.html).

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/445/643/original.png?f=1609881215&Expires=1748567753&Signature=JE-7VGTTBigxqkFUyjHaGvFK3kydQahbGerUbd~wBC738jUl~zSGw~xNxNdqAPXnR2FWhFpk0uKLEA04WBqZohLczFtDAsyyjQRzxgXR0PTU1aK0Kp-NPg2M16PTkoKjC9a7DMMKWaCDqez0Q4~4RqbZc0JwW72zSzIxxxLGCiv62w-kBGlEFQba71rNvlHuqXtkedadf7ScHiIbLXKHceK1HNSuRxjA5LULQPUaIRVMPj159t~QuaNl6JIJf2Xx14ie1Hab5wQ2o6JH7mNa5kZZ1LP11YwEsdGDFZkquDdW16h~TjOhnTtcNKTEb0RvBmvBy~Xm~XDJg7CdZbRtoQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Once you have an API Key, you will need to generate an **Access Token**, using the [Constant Contact API Tester](https://constantcontact.mashery.com/io-docs).

# Step by step guide on how to create a Bridge

**Step by step guide on how to create a bridge**

If you are starting now on using LeadsBridge, this guide is for you: you will see how to build a Simple Bridge step by step.

**Step 1:** Click on the ‘ _Create new Bridge_’ button

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/891/379/original.png?f=1695108200&Expires=1748567763&Signature=FQGDXXMKdy92h0USp6GwgNoHHyjyXX5AM3ZkS2D73uVO6OF~x~J2LnxKU70dAqvnxvbp4WaRY3O8ndYiuR9uy3JMHVHI7anVWO-6WhKvxh2-oqYo46Z9hUF-oC5Q6Yd5wdSlRnnXKqf8ErPfWa3bhS5lkg27ESrx1Ll-Amus~yvS~rjRyIWPyLhc42mr-FRqK1gVnHd6a9wFXd5GB8PVsn3e1QQnac9UMkGtdKBRuWgpsLtBrCPooye1u89Cf7vcts6mf2oHltTZ9uNjs1oj7WIqzpXoUl~40uYBQfFMoJRMzRU7d-WIsHxum6b1KXYnW~GiOUxkN~vo1vXMVqLNEg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

**Step 2:** Choose the apps you want to connect.

LeadsBridge offers integrations with more than [300 integrations](https://leadsbridge.com/integrations/). Please note that some integrations are available only starting from the [Pro Plan](https://leadsbridge.com/pricing/)and also that some of them are available only as a Source and others only as Destination.

[Here](https://leadsbridge.com/pro-plan-pricing/ ""https://leadsbridge.com/pro-plan-pricing/"") you have a full view of the Pro plan pricing table. Also, check [this article](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5039672-how-do-i-choose-the-right-plan-for-me)to learn more about our Pro plan features.

In this example, we have chosen two widely used Integrations: [Facebook Lead Ads and Google Sheet](https://leadsbridge.com/integrations/facebook-lead-ads/google-sheets/).

**Step 3:** Select Source and Destination

Define which specific assets you want to connect to LeadsBridge as Source and Destination. A dialog box will be opened with the specific integration you have chosen in order to authorize LeadsBridge to access these assets of your interest.

**Step 4:** Choose the assets involved in the sync

After the Authentication,you are able to re-define every asset involved in the Bridge. The example below shows how to create a new Lead Ad form in case you don’t have any yet on the Page you’ve selected. Otherwise, the dropdown menu will show you the available forms.

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/891/382/original.png?f=1695108359&Expires=1748567763&Signature=Hqr80t-9ucrCYn-BV9gSGBqQfRbDaJPLJXsJ7HnY3EPNkqgnzD7JhvXNkhTGsUBXaa~4l~VAx7XX7izCQ1A~JgjE91lZauwxhBFUJjX~2fpBpceFCj~X~7yBnGE~qgO6NSD2Yp~ar9Of4VX833j17nsW-UUA3KbX4Tobblnwic2NFJO1Km4Drhcqej440DklSTVqHcdg-HAHCqq3iyIwXMvPLcSTRrCzpVxa8nEaigHeVFE0BnAuFjWYah07K7GGlQZGsqC~p420ds3pXa6kzooJAECe7xYNFCEKefr343aYsHqJ0klcdLW3b5y-XjFdzOQSnPR9rnKBaH~LXGe3iw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

This step needs to be done also on the Destination side, as shown in the example. Once you have done with both the Source and Destination, you are ready to proceed to the next step.

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/891/383/original.png?f=1695108389&Expires=1748567763&Signature=c0Tu5RT8K7~v6DPbfRJ0Hku6FaulpdCpITQ6A3OhGSLN4SfSHTupGntCUGsDk~zQHIQJDjTRuFkqGmrG71nudFZGawqv1HfQVYexklvb5iRZ44u5qhIPFP4oUG~fDnBT4h7ARY5H3FX6Du6ZzxjezjWodTL4Q0IpwNji~C0189WkDrNodlyXHF2C~nfpKJ7KlG3RfHl6cJF1pg96FFSFa76eLs~DFCNqBRxFiIcCt9WHOZsgSM9suZ2UG-2ytQkMxKA7AtThHs3jbiME8hov4BiJ4Q7DeA-wagpt~NGbsCJJ71beLzfYg~z15Dsz2XcPziDryNEF9r073S5uZXXW9g__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

**Step 5:** Map the fields

The _Fields mapping_ Step will allow you to set where the data coming from the Source will be synced to your destination. You can leave empty the fields you don’t need to map, such as ‘Campaign’ and ‘Created time’ in the example on the next step.

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/254/952/original.png?f=1712327871&Expires=1748567764&Signature=jxf7OHU68U-sKenOJ-doV-OJ~QXUFBhs5y~4QI7aWA5E5lNGyQc3Ng3zFPT0BYvGDPim7JSCcymUvrjAYdKTBbPrIIvAZ0m~xXF9Vh3Q-oqjJ4LNUUhO1SYr5ABHeiNCM6LeK38QUIgVMftFZf4Ek9U~8aTd0Jxfn4f4naIEOOp9gzyBKZcb4tspSYRM93C9-NJMgQjyPm4I4B1TAu0TBZO86vI0q9v82UUtfPB2x-o4gGpk~MjP2I~gg4ekx9slTlyCVkxw8yu4E~n8EoPt8yeA8IMu48pK78M92~9Q09wmWsuj94ZQer5q0RSsm6uOnSvJIHZ4Wib2CxlC4ac5aA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Alternatively, if you need to map the additional fields that are not visible on the step, you can click **Show unmapped fields** near the search option to get the full visibility of your destination fields and proceed with mapping.

**Step 6:** Test and Publish

Once you’ve mapped all the fields you need, you are now ready for the final steps you can decide if to run a test or publish the Bridge straight away.

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/254/961/original.png?f=1712328254&Expires=1748567764&Signature=vDeUdXJTfkxHnHonuDQMoa4rEueX5krqMDaeOMHsOQspga~rOJS4JjyGDS5QBiRV7TmbOl~RyeH2QckxCuEqJnYRaIEjNUQ8l5Omc35SlpXg4365TnV0v2nWM6R1nULf3TD1RPIAV6G0MubP5zpCDepOh8r4cwdbVC6SotT5tIocmgVbPQ9E6rjWahtD1BSZz3SQAOzrr~TdckOVKhhOEodm6KrdatLziNEq6IIm-h-JvDKyWaKPrALSuFDAFARuswC7007xhrgvOmm2MRrxM~SA3pk4pLtG4iTPviqGBcoXncmaQf9wRtWntCjPTgcOEWMoPTvvcAou9U6b16gdsA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

If you decide to test the Bridge, you will have the chance to insert test info that you’ll be then able to retrieve easily into your destination.

# Flagging Sensitive Data with TrustedForm Certify

# Overview

Per the [TrustedForm EULA](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform-eula/), the TrustedForm service may not be used to capture sensitive consumer data. Examples of sensitive data include credit card numbers, bank account numbers, social security numbers (SSNs), and driver's license numbers. If you use [TrustedForm Certify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/certify/) to collect sensitive data, you **must** flag these fields as sensitive.

# How Do I Protect Fields with Sensitive Data Flagging?

TrustedForm Certify allows you to flag any part of a form that contains sensitive data. When this feature is used, we apply a cryptographic hash to the flagged fields making it infeasible for anyone, including us, to store, retrieve, reverse-engineer, or utilize the data that was volunteered by the end-user in that flagged data field.

When a TrustedForm session replay is viewed, the data in a flagged field will be seen only as a series of asterisks or removed completely. In order for you to protect sensitive data and still have a recognizable certificate for compliance, we recommend only flagging fields that truly collect sensitive data.

# Implementation

## Flagging Individual Fields as Sensitive Data

By default, field data collected in form inputs are not considered sensitive by TrustedForm Certify. If you use it as provided and do not flag any fields as sensitive, it will capture any fields filled out while it is active.

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/597/213/original.png?f=1676399425&Expires=1748567794&Signature=jvKV-PdXYt0H1W4kpHmEcYJ1l80RNgFc8ZY4ysAS2NWHFOlQt2NIUx~k36zkLM4OXP~tF-xy~u7bDQIa6D0FQsdO9pl9C0kUhisxNqLhREwPnWk8Gd3UkKCzRng1DA3BX4F59zrYaWhGpJ358dqSDBpTHDGPTYWR8GuwYQuqg7HXDcUXLh9j2d-19lsRg3tWsBOuaNhUSaNv0XFJCkPm~z6zGJApLcx7wAOXKshpkrjd2BStE4GatD7Z91cOU7YViX2T8FbCVWusFtCKMEWOw4b26kWfjbcyDmQHi0bqZU4NuXbr1pbq-NMYZh~1TNe9R3aD1RsHa0a6ENnMF6PTfg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)Sensitive Fields in a TrustedForm Certificate

To protect the value of a field flag it as sensitive using the below attribute:

`data-tf-sensitive=""true""`

Example: Sensitive field

`<input type=""text"" name=""ssn"" data-tf-sensitive=""true"" />`

_Note: Checkboxes and widgets such as date-pickers will have their value protected but will still show visual indication of what the consumer clicked. To hide this completely please flag their parent element as sensitive._

## Flagging Content as Sensitive Data

By default, all content on the page is captured as part of the session replay. If you wish to hide more than the field value you may use the `data-tf-sensitive=""true""` attribute on a content tag(e.g. div, img, p, span) to obscure that tag and all of its child elements. The content will be replaced by a placeholder that indicates it has been hidden by you.

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/597/202/original.png?f=1676399203&Expires=1748567794&Signature=CxvB20CKqWjePaSGka7adPqAe9ZBNh74yAk9k0AVEYNReBTDSxLlryhcrBqJ8w92Q4ytILbd4kQSbaKQIBG2uisIexYmeZF~my42bhqXFNAz2B8UbDUyhnB~BUepYg~tA7Bi~Bzs1kJkDMLbJreDLpU77sGIpgoR-DZPuguNAwcLMUhXiHCN2BwMRTcU27bbGZVPt8NuKxZIRqkPLsuKIl6Zn-dEQIoStpgoVFZg7Y8~Ew-PW0jIEEmTtwfgG-uxrcIH3nRVkA81bKrk2mg4sa5Nx9xBdJTlzW~swecNtRpBDYdb3liWgB6lledCKe-S4W~pvDmAO-bt51oUiJjd~g__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)Sensitive Content in a TrustedForm Certificate

Example: Sensitive image

`<img src=""graphic.jpg"" data-tf-sensitive=""true"" />`

Example: Sensitive div containing a checkbox

`<div data-tf-sensitive=""true"">`

`  <input type=""checkbox"" />`

`</div>`

## Treating All Fields as Sensitive Data

TrustedForm also supports the ability to treat all fields as sensitive data. When this option is selected, you can flag individual fields that you don't want to be treated as sensitive.

In order to switch to this option, toggle the **invertFieldSensitivity** variable in the TrustedForm Certify Web SDK to true.

When the **invertFieldSensitivity** variable toggle is enabled, you must explicitly mark fields you want the TrustedForm Certify to capture:

`<input type=""text"" name=""phone"" data-tf-sensitive=""false"" />`

_Note: This only applies to standard input tags. Other elements you use to collect user input will not be treated as sensitive._

# TrustedForm Retain: Using the Auto-Retain method to store certificates for first party leads

Automatically retain your TrustedForm Certificates generated from your verified domains without making an API request

Are you struggling to set up an integration to retain TrustedForm Certificates for the leads you generated? Do you wish that you could simply store all the certificates for leads from your websites? If so, then you should use TrustedForm's new solution designed to help you store proof of consent for first-party leads.

Traditionally, our users have always had to make an API request to retain TrustedForm Certificates. This gave technical users a lot of flexibility to integrate this step however they want but created a challenge for those who don't have the experience or resources to develop a process to do this. TrustedForm Auto-Retain seeks to make it easy for anyone to retain proof of consent for the leads they generate.

# How It Works

TrustedForm Auto-Retain works in conjunction with the TrustedForm Certify Web SDK to recognize when a lead is submitted on your website and automatically stores that lead's TrustedForm Certificate to your account. You can set up this process in a just a few steps:

1. **Verify your domains**

In order to know which certificates we should retain in your account, you must prove you own the domain they are generated from. Simply follow the instructions in the [Verify Domain Ownership](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4649879-verify-domain-ownership) guide so that you will have the ability to enable TrustedForm Auto-Retain for them.
2. **Open the TrustedForm application**

Auto-Retain can be enabled on the [Issuing Certificates page of the TrustedForm application](https://app.trustedform.com/certificates/issue?__hstc=41051389.5e2b2e0d8372c4b7b69fa461e80f8e90.1748564173795.1748564173795.1748564173795.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564173795&__hsfp=3707738794). Scroll to the bottom, and you will see a section marked ""Auto-Retain Confirmed Domains.![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/944/769/original.png?f=1745994393&Expires=1748567772&Signature=nPp1Nd5bj74TI-x8Y5Ph~GYW~aRkU3NutDPwDwKDWCbUbRBPV8-Cz8oIutmeQjaMXwYOwE0fnN~euRBZe5W3d0Cm~j1Eb6884VZQ5qzsXy~asjC8k8IHWT2ksi2UmPMPvTr83KEGQ10Fql-QnL7abP8qV4wpBLouxYFxKFpgIpJvRofPifV0osWNdpc4rAuLdIUO1~AXCXexWw95Eg6irI-5k0s~Adjq8IrStW6LvZxkf7mY8ANcr3pTqBwzfJ71zq7z~kCzEB1DKLjS5dPF1jO3IpgErBCB4iFcGdZ~N8qLEY6r7TIyLotmXcZwODXB3lwaUbl0cF3DjtB~YfnPYg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)
3. **Enable Auto-Retain** Toggle the Auto Retain switch to 'Enabled' next to each of your verified domains to confirm that you would like to retain all certificates for the leads generated from them. Once Auto Retain is enabled, the switch will update to give you the option to disable it if needed.

If your account has not been configured to use Auto-Retain, you will see a message with instructions on how to proceed so that you can be provided access.



_(New Update) If the **'Subdomain Ownership Status'** is **'Unconfirmed'**, follow the instructions in [Verify Domain Ownership](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4649879-verify-domain-ownership?_gl=1*zqdwg8*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NDU2MDAxMjguQ2owS0NRandoWVNfQmhEMkFSSXNBSlRNTVFiaXRYMkdhRFdWemNDYW0wOFJtNXpFNzRLbHpuVEtxMkxjWV9JN2VIRU5wcGZJZFo1dzFOb2FBb2VXRUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_au*MTI0OTE0OTIxNS4xNzQ0NjM5NjA2LjY1MDQxMjc5OC4xNzQ1ODc5MTYxLjE3NDU4NzkxODE.*_ga*NTQ3NjI0NDQxLjE3MzQ2Mzk3NDQ.*_ga_QHXBV6N7D1*MTc0NTk4Nzc4Ny4xODEuMS4xNzQ1OTkzNjA2LjQ1LjAuNDE0MTA2MzQw) to complete the subdomain verification process (optional). Once the status is set to 'Confirmed' and Auto-retain is enabled, then auto-retain will be enabled for the root domain and **all associated** subdomains._

# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **How do I know that Auto-Retain is working?**

After a lead is **submitted\*** to your website, wait at least 15 minutes and then visit the TrustedForm Certificate URL for that lead. If you are able to view the full certificate, it has been successfully retained your account. It will also appear in your [recent stored certificates](https://app.trustedform.com/claims?__hstc=41051389.5e2b2e0d8372c4b7b69fa461e80f8e90.1748564173795.1748564173795.1748564173795.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564173795&__hsfp=3707738794). You should also monitor your usage on the TrustedForm home page as any sudden increases/decreases could indicate an issue. Reach out to [support@activeprospect.com](mailto:support@activeprospect.com) if your certificates are not being retained.

_**\*Please note there must be a form submission for auto-retain to work.**_

2. **Do I have to store the TrustedForm Certificate URL with the lead?**

Yes, we always recommend storing the TrustedForm Certificate URL in a CRM or similar system alongside all other lead data. In the future, we will release features to help you find certificates without knowing the URL, but it is always a best practice to maintain a record of it.

3. **Will Auto-Retain be included in my current allotment/volume?**

No, Auto-Retain is tracked separately from other methods of storing certificates. Please consult your specific pricing specifications for details.

4. **If I use Auto-Retain will my lead buyers be able to access/view my certificates?**

No, in order for your lead buyers to gain access to view your certificates you must first provide them with the TrustedForm Certificate URL. Then they will have to use the TrustedForm API to retain the certificate in their own account.

5. **If I already use other TrustedForm products, is there an additional cost to use Auto-Retain?**

Auto-Retain is a feature of the Retain product offering. Usage of it will be billed as Retain First Party on your invoice based on your rate.

6. **Will the certificates retained via the Auto-Retain product be used when generating the dashboard that appears on the TrustedForm home page?**

Yes, the TrustedForm home page shows aggregate information pertaining to all the certificates retained in your account regardless of which product was used to do so.

7. **If I use Auto-Retain how can I also use TrustedForm Insights on these certificates?**

TrustedForm Insights is an API product which operates separately from TrustedForm Auto-Retain. Although the two can be used in conjunction, TrustedForm Insights requires its own setup with your development team or through a third party integration. Read the [TrustedForm Insights](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4709758-trustedform-insights) article for more information.

8. **What happens to my certificates where TrustedForm Certify doesn't detect a form submission event?**

Any certificates where a form submission is not detected will not be stored to your account as this normally indicates the consumer did not become a lead and does not want to be marketed to. They will expired 3 days after creation and be deleted. If you believe an error has occurred and desire to retain these certificate you will have to do so using the [TrustedForm Certificate API](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/getting-started/).

9. **How does TrustedForm Certify detect form submission events?**

**TrustedForm Certify listens for events that explicitly indicate a form has been submitted or are associated with elements on a page that behave like a submit button. The script is expected to accurately capture these submit events from any webpage using a standard <form> tag with a submit button embedded inside of it.**

# Troubleshooting Batch File Delivery Errors

**Error:** Not delivered due to error: Message length is more than 10485760 bytes long: 'XXX'.

**Resolution:**

1. Enable .zip file deliveries by checking **Compress delivered files into .zip files** under the Advanced setting in File Settings.
2. After saving the settings, click ""Resend"" under Processed Files and select the option to use new settings.

* * *

**Error:** Not delivered due to error: Message rejected: could not be delivered to 'xxx@xxx.xx'

Note: If no action is taken, leads will be included in the next scheduled delivery.

**Resolution:**

1. Please ensure that **delivery@yourlead.info** is whitelisted
2. Ensure all email addresses the batch file is being delivered to are active and not responding with bounce notifications - this includes both Permanent bounces (account issues) and transient bounces (typically an Out of Office notification).
   - **Optional:** Edit Batch File Delivery to remove out of office emails from the delivery.
3. After ensuring that there are no bounce notifications, click ""Resend"" under Processed Files.

* * *

**Error:** Not delivered due to error: Error establishing initial connection to SFTP: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND

**Resolution:**

1. Please ensure that domain/subdomain that you are trying to deliver to exists and is publicly accessible.
2. Ensure all the domain is spelled correctly in the the batch file configuration.

# The field I need doesn't exist in Standard Fields. Can I create a custom field?

LeadConduit has hundreds of _Standard Fields_ that include built in type verification (like email, phone number, zip/postal code, etc.) but sometimes you have a unique use case and that's what _Custom Fields_ are for.

Because custom fields are unique to your LeadConduit account, LeadConduit requires you to define a custom suffix that will be used in all your custom fields' parameter names.

# Step Components

Steps have a variety of options, depending on what kind of step they are.

# Rules

Only Filters can have rules. Rules define the requirements wherein you want to stop a lead from processing further. This can be as basic as ""Stop when the previous step failed"".

In this example, the filter will stop the lead flow if the outcome of the My Personal CRM step is anything other than Success (Errors, Failures, and Skips will all stop the flow).

# Field Mappings

Some steps require configuration (e.g. a Posting URL, an API key) , some steps just you need to connect the field names between LeadConduit and the service you are delivering to, and some steps require no field mappings at all. Whatever the case, LeadConduit will warn you if you need additional configuration.

# Enable / Disable Batch Deliveries

Disabling Deliveries does not prevent the collection of lead data. The batch files simply won't be delivered until the delivery is re-enabled.

# Deliver Pending Batch Files

Sometimes you'll need to deliver a batch file ahead of schedule. You can do so from the Batches section of the library.

By default, any leads delivered in a batch file are cleared from the queue. However, you have the option to deliver the leads from this out of sync batch in the next scheduled delivery as well.

# Make a Copy

Making a copy will start the Batch File Delivery Wizard, but starts with the configuration from the file you're copying, instead of a blank slate.

# Delete a Batch File Delivery

Before you can delete a Batch File Delivery you must remove it from all flows referencing it to prevent errors.

# Pixel Tracker

Sometimes you'll need to fire a web beacon (also commonly known as a tracking pixel) for a third-party service (e.g. Google Analytics, HasOffers). You can use LeadConduit's built-in Pixel Tracker integration to call the service.

In the **Steps** section of the Flow editor, choose **Add Recipient** and select the **Pixel Tracker** integration from the options.

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/452/582/original.png?f=1610138070&Expires=1748567753&Signature=cdTZPEF8lnuPzAzHgTUZT8HbBLE6OaV9JK8luKx5s~ddu941pJvBY9vxOurFJ-I25N~Q5Z5cvth5xOr8p0VeFSNxVLGzs5ewXClzFY-nlzOJdJ7lLmbKyIvtCWd7d6jOyd22Dqp8965J5h8U2ao-XQ0JTpOy15C4qhQ-VrL7qD5lH9SrYMPLkHrI2wb~xPqZDWQCwPnx73Ur3~okHzUd~V21-kNsDxgzjDGagmQzDkm2xTgkiZxgfM37rVRQvLDa1TSL7yyAhBaDNwofThHe4kR0qDkLdJIy9OnqK~MRRMHl3yxOOqaMQnG-D6ldMueEKoPl6gqUtixhwDSx2u94RA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Once the Pixel Tracker is added to your flow you need to add the URL of the web beacon you want to call with the appropriate parameters.

Let's say you want to call **Google Analytics Tracking Pixel** and use the **LeadConduit Lead ID** as the unique identifier.

Here are the base URL and Parameters we'll use as a reference point:

**Base URL:**

[http://www.google-analytics.com/collect](http://www.google-analytics.com/collect)

**Parameters:**

- v=1
- tid=UA-XXXXXXX-YY
- cid= **LEAD-ID-GOES-HERE**
- t=event

You click on **Edit Field Mappings** button for the Pixel Tracker step, then copy + paste your URL into the URL field.

Next, add a few lines and map the Name+Value pairs as shown below:

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/452/583/original.png?f=1610138096&Expires=1748567753&Signature=gCOLR7yMsNZgbaZdtiM6G-MsQRa35El45VkSNZR85tpfRRxLhHuWJJhAq50Xpwv8cT7E1oAmFmM6WHDls1uM4UHuH8TeLe5E-apiHxrp8sDqS8qWJgf8UFUMImaFQsFrnW76xjWmCANe0Sweo8rBu7ZYF~B-0bhNkgW1sBBiLongupr18sCPDXnFbj8lKFvSOnxuQDNmt~YdtX6ZT~1rw7ytbxc9OG-CUucgdU3~sCCRb3aX-ErorVjBxRKOw5EDAgxs6Cs2T9flC2YMWbrL7C2zPJBK6DosfRHVx5qPKjy1Cr49tjgW2zy2X5TZV00A9vEPrl29C3roQ~-ndFc9qQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Then click Ok and Save your flow. You're good to go!

# Lead Pricing

LeadConduit offers powerful, flexible, rules-based lead pricing. You can price both the ""purchase"" side (what leads cost you i.e what you will pay the lead source for a successful lead) and the ""sale"" side (what revenue you will gain from a successfully delivered lead i.e. what a lead's buyers will pay you).

# Purchase (Source) Pricing

To set up purchase-side pricing in a flow, go to the flow's Sources tab.

You can set purchase prices for each source, for the flow, or both. Source-level pricing overrides flow-level pricing.

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/373/743/original.png?f=1606258378&Expires=1748567753&Signature=h9980akWGtCaWB5cbnWQHFH0d9r~9yuIvKpGmtGYaeBhFujN6x5OiqXjurZ0SLJkaShvuYv2QcPqAVh6VA35w3RTkdd~r-eaKvBrQDi~Y~rnEA6XcFLR~9FN59YM1G8KgTQsZX0Y7~14a-VVGp5krkyNkHH2pegoGkgrLhVGRK0QF21UGzpxOdKuvWqQZNuVs1XH60HwkMkeaGifOCOVf51FJL2soS8g6golUKqGlCktM0INk3EAwWY14j-tgfartIvJ5yBDoWuJ~VNv03w31llMSjxytZGdWLSKiN9erNyDFYZ7UVQxhB0ruqi5SeaSW3aSfE-P7AtVYeG1u0ZXZg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Sources can also submit their own ""price"" field with the lead. Here's how that field appears in the source's Submission docs:

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/341/903/original.png?f=1605201927&Expires=1748567753&Signature=gWygNFlaxuzAZXdB2VtzIfj~yk4rn~8rbeMn0xgPHHzB2Ie8pjl2cjjWTpGTcXqvVibC~fSud~tnWhc8~bwEi47T~JqJTMNqXvqhjy2HFw036dUHpSjiyBF7kEe~WynOzddbwyRxFBYkGriSk4xC8NCtNCkVP~I2~wMoZ5KJILaAGypCkKBRBZ0oJ8qszl6JtMyf2gt7NoYAryMWcoQU-Qu0NmjHzD9LN6Q9Q~SlsmS1rUtzHYf8FNo-E46dunIwmSkyGZI2yoG2zdqJ66NzqrmjGZiUnf4SpMaBBS-2ka-gPTqfwk14ygzKrhYekTB7CBBNFzi9vSxHa59DA0WoYA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

You have the option at the flow and source-levels to either set up your own rule-based prices or to accept the source-submitted price as part of the lead data. Rule-based pricing blocks source-submitted prices and vice versa. You must use one or the other at each level or source, but you can accept submitted prices for one source while using rule-based prices for another source.

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/341/905/original.png?f=1605201946&Expires=1748567753&Signature=sychOUJVqvk6w6evUxzKaXUaUi-hIY-Qpp9-PGrF3RTZOhxutwbI2Kgv8RPFTVl8a~sEY37fuWH1X4o00rqPdGmwyjNvuuwGe2Hkkgy5ILfMUlKXPgq5vKCxbS3yvKXSws9kVp8u30fz-H4fX-TmpAab5Pz6zv5BnDyiXwDDaF5HGiKpojHi4bl~olr76laGvtQRLNBRLcUlaN~tTI5rmjlqMws-FfVOhE828snu-gF~xVVXxJ5vePTxL9cNCC45~PzFypO7y5i7XV8seLjPn1Q0tvArDLVVAxWN60o0BXO0jQQzmTxEztU7uY4v16ADq1j3DiysW5X4EdOpAqmeiQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

You can set multiple prices using LeadConduit's powerful rules. You can create rule sets and nested rules, too.

# Sale Pricing

You can add Sale pricing (what the buyer will pay you) to any Delivery step.

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/373/758/original.png?f=1606258561&Expires=1748567753&Signature=iwygWIkfvKL46g0mT5QA-fj7NlM6OVFVuKMAzTsf0ou8WLjbt-gIZCJFaTCMSRHTmTmWO8sOjJeQmHTxlAhCTev3DOttVo-sDt3LofMCD~XeTsj2TepEZDuAL60ZAdZdMOjd6ewCbAIdjwkLoUZpQJUM5xoBbSn~e5vHGcJtihw6GkQ-DmN9SWs5XuRxhCtrldhHrwqrruKELBCH-DTAtCddVQaeBMn9c8zh8bQ-~rUdMWOsB9DZ3xi8kXptEWlupkx6G0j91b2aK9-fFaLaWMPqMwpzyaVjpIfR35MCqQPDYSXYO6coMqD70SzbCQtcQjKBb5Xr3kqGsPWmtImSbA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Similar to Purchase pricing, you can set your own rule-based price or, for leads delivered to another LeadConduit flow, accept the price the buyer provides in their response. Rule-based pricing blocks Buyer-provided prices and vice versa.

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/341/910/original.png?f=1605202033&Expires=1748567753&Signature=LDDsQ6DGtj25VEN1w4MEfcDs1S8YBFDWRb-oLGVon7pzQk4vrLsGW9mWy2KuqEGryVT-1sMh7IO5xbWhM4tAwTfygStO0WN5YNcnZEEFPZR9Vkct~EvB-UXQbafe5WCIsR-E1JKNspcvknx30~LV3ClPoffJw~A0GmBvDupPyq~lbvek4HdNqhcHyyDyxlHwkeRj6JWZwGHGldmBUUokKy43Bd~5jptMu-P8xAeur~7xtjN0NyEnfRpqM4XjcV5SnDLrwfXO3U38ieHflqEgAPtevsqf2J3o4cZRox3SMt7UaccFcsliank0GR2AKudVHr--dDzK64UDrPkEBHAe7Q__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

You have the same ability to set multiple, rules-based sale prices as you do for purchase pricing.

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/341/911/original.png?f=1605202082&Expires=1748567753&Signature=TyMOW9hUgGcmzFnz4ODwc5OtIrYUU2CQcT4Fz4IcP0Hx6CB1aR4os6gZNxm-ocllI0WiRkIsmjU7qZZdQAYDhZA4G48c0GisHtMw5GQXQPVpQ9yr0oNAZOmSkrjmzDQ1HmCqEbFF5BuSMxdz~juI5ETC07KS5OXYcHXrITAmN4oihtDuoEXqc48P9Ft-OqFZPjaPl8nwd8W2lQfRR9ZHDOQyJWFFIYkAtSHoC~m28NwX1lNJIHG6J2xW9vSSkKzO0-rVhBn2DJVoljiWqzWkf-EAk-jstm1whUyApwrfJ5nOy4LlJDob6CHNZ318JzSxpsJeCAEXL5xDFQpa2imwQA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

# Flow Links

Clicking on a flow name will take you to the flow’s main page.

Note that deleted flows are represented by the Flow ID strings (a lowercase alphanumeric string) rather than a “friendly name”. Clicking on the link for a deleted flow will result in an error.

# Events Tab Links

# Data Persistence

Data older than your account’s data retention period are not included in any reports. See [your LeadConduit subscription’s settings](https://next.leadconduit.com/settings) for data retention information.

# Making a Decision

A filter must be added after the step in order to make any decision based on the outcome of the delivery. Usually, you'll want to stop the flow when the outcome of the delivery is anything other than Success. A filter that catches Failures, Errors, and Skips will do the trick. Here's what that looks like:

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/452/212/original.png?f=1610131373&Expires=1748567753&Signature=J--ju9I7pTRMw3bHhaLXZbh6rkxIVrkM4VU40Usw9oAfIq~5EXs4NXx0dl4oZsRjSNTz~ZmHPloGUfxFSzWY22gYfTplWe-NgEWGbuD-wmYOqPsB-x8tlHDjF7F22hiMbctwD57JSoicuRrYr~B5D4zV6vDCmnvLGryrKpmVcAB7U55Nqc9YFwURf~tJ5vU8QJyReUDXLKo7TRhFhl7Xntya3dFmJb6K8UWZuLVUyKdUefi7WTtUxpegM9Htx~IpFK5pP6SQ08AScdmRmbpk4ycu4o1mz1qRiHBP8oZ8qwZ3CPTEhSIqpnMeBzcgSVvK6f5gVr1TBMii-ood4FEUEQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

# Disabling a Flow Step

To **Disable** a flow step, click the gear icon of the step you want disabled and select the appropriate option:

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/410/557/original.png?f=1607964212&Expires=1748567754&Signature=WhOlLES7kF1f72bZdZpwcYoGbDcadIK3R6yEhjOnDgh6UUUya0Vvm4VpwVG4K-mVNLYzfqxnmKVvWoPDmvXDqw1FUkSfKdIOyHMiaZ9ht9S2WgV~yuwsaMtHIrrwKBWuFvZ3zrGhpHN14n-~WIVVC8R4pSHKCszyNWqewQ1vIduBprWJ5tTgtdVmYZvtb7xh-F1gz1bO9IKKM3vW6oo5V3~r04AzFBIMtfJJM1jaA6BgTMOLVyTev4IhNK8W1A20tbox2tvuMceGQPeO5AL8UUGzPSoh63twokaS0F4l0--xKAYaSx6bzE6nZ2hOgZNOHoaZYQyPkltHIaur8TIy6A__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

If any downstream steps have **Step Criteria** (Filters, Enhancements, or Deliveries) related to this step, a Warning prompt will appear. As the warning says, flow behavior will be unpredictable, especially if these downstream steps rely on appended data from the Disable Step.

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/410/558/original.png?f=1607964230&Expires=1748567754&Signature=eVgAyQU4-PwNbhvFEVUHVuux6-xb0ArN1DktKiEC6LNsTQDqhpQbvoXRYnOBl3quvqslrET1UVBOY1CYzsqXzmjekJit2Gh7RVN4y9bxKr8wMd0LOuJn7M3xn-SqXWaMd8XPcAz8VrS9rodHjX9aupIl3zPtF4sgx4w7zIPcQRmHwk5h82wc~x61y-tgE9xytjfxTC2XxiDuI5U~BTMPeN29g0WXWHy~hQd1ow5Tzzd1JR6~mZRsP~EyUqA45rXLfMh0MteklQa9kJzZqKFr605RgGhKn0IWwo4hvv1JQS6Wwlwj5B89JkfLFsWUbYghtI~G70A7Uxp4SArr11CXvw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

# Constant Contact: Email Marketing

ActiveProspect partners with Constant Contact to offer sections of the [Constant Contact API](https://developer.constantcontact.com/) directly through LeadConduit.

You can use the LeadConduitConstant Contact Integration to Add a Contact to an existing List.

What you'll need to get started:

- A Constant Contact account
- An API Key
- An Access Token
- A List ID

The documentation below will show you where to find the List ID and how to generate an API Key.

# Finding What You Need

First, you'll need an **API Key** from Constant Contact. They have extensive online documentation for how to [generate a Constant Contact API Key](https://developer.constantcontact.com/api_guide/getting_started.html).

Once you have an API Key, you will need to generate an **Access Token**, using the [Constant Contact API Tester](https://constantcontact.mashery.com/io-docs).

Finally, use the [Contact List endpoint](https://developer.constantcontact.com/docs/contact-list-api/contactlist-collection.html) to determine the **List ID**. Unfortunately, Constant Contact does not reveal the List ID in the UI so you _must_ use the API to determine the appropriate list ID.

# Configuring Constant Contact in LeadConduit

From your selected Flow, choose Edit, scroll to the bottom of the **Steps** tab, select the **Add Delivery** option, and search for/scroll to Constant Contact and select.

Next, you'll need to provide some information so LeadConduit can communicate with Constant Contact.

The email you collect with the lead will automatically be sent to theConstant Contact API and you don't need to manually map it in the field mapping section.

At a minimum, this is all that is required to add an email to your Constant Contact list. Congrats!

Click **Ok** and **Save** the flow.

# Advanced Configuration Options

The following Optional fields are also supported:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Middle Name
- Salutation
- Phone 1
- Fax
- Address 1
- Address 2
- Postal Code
- Country
- Country Code: The Country Code
- State: The State Code
- City: The City
- Company Name: The Consumer Employer Name
- Company Phone: The Company phone number
- Title: The Job title
- Company Address: The Company Address
- Company Address 2: The Company address 2
- Company City: The Company Address City
- Company Country Code: The Company Address Country Code
- Company State: The Company Address State Code
- Company Postal Code: The Company Address Postal Code

These field values are available from the Right-Hand menu in the MailChimp field mapping section.

# Interpreting the Results

A success response means that the lead was successfully added to the list.

Failure response means that the lead was not successfully added to the list. It could have been a duplicate. You can check the reason logged in LeadConduit to determine the exact reason.

The integration returns the following fields:

- **Outcome:** Integration outcome (success, failure, or error)
- **Reason:** If the outcome is an error, the error reason
- **Contact ID:** The ID of the contact that was added to the contact list
- **Contact Status:** Contact Status
- **Source:** How the contact was added, from an application, web page, etc. e.g. API
- **Confirmed:** If the contact has confirmed their email subscription
- **Email Address:** Email address added to the list
- **Email Address ID:** ID of Email address added to the list
- **List ID:** Constant Contact List-Id
- **List Status:** Constant Contact List Status
- **Opt-In Date:** Email Address(Constant Contact) Opt-in Date
- **Opt-In Source:** Email Address(Constant Contact) Opt-in Source
- **Source Details:** Name of the application used to add contact, if added using the API

# Filtering for Profanity Using SuppressionList

Some users want to reject leads that contain profanity words because they consider those leads to be unreliable. Configuring your LeadConduit flow to reject leads with profanity words only takes a few steps.

**Step 1.** Formulate a list of words you would like to include on your profanity list. Store those words in a .csv file.

**Step 2.** Create a new list in your SuppressionList account, and upload your profanity words file to it. See our knowledge base for ""Creating a New List Using the UI"" and ""Bulk Adding or Replacing List Entries With the UI and Deleting a List"".

**Step 3.** Include a SuppressionList query step in your LeadConduit flow to check if the field contains a word on your profanity list. Include a filter after this step to stop the flow if you find a profanity word.

Here are two examples of step configurations that **WILL** work:

_Example 1._

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/401/882/original.png?f=1607551417&Expires=1748567753&Signature=MGblARbF39L~IyKeuybMsxtD5QOUbwkcolKFS~l35uTZcvfcqv1ce0VXxxbDGxNP1s2cF32HVrr9EAxqg1n2vinh3lpIbm-4HWV-UfS29Pw~JuMBqzSbTdzXV1iFcrPt2eyVEtIfLZw-KS65B1KG-y2HSpfjsialyFutNVlxdLNgObeb-mvrqQMZzf6et6n1-6wAQimlpdXUM-AFg9Q8ommU3nKKc6LEb9BZqbP0fIGFd7PF~sfuFSjd5BRbC6fxva0eK-7NM~RPSlI4JxSVPQRxx12Q1AaRPu~-L6GbX8QJ-DNvpSq7l1bosDSWCVgPARlhcxGj17nE5I4suxIRdA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

_Example 2._

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/401/886/original.png?f=1607551441&Expires=1748567753&Signature=IfCeRFrP9UE6fIO2ftLbgedviNwufqBcf7iXv8PAIuqqUDp8PjJkXwC62Q6YzVpjEYbcdxq~AGvO8~Zhcc9bIKUNuYvVqTwDERVxY3CGYwVm3H0C-kl8qBvIxQUaNveG~P9R-e6DdKlFRhqdETIbecGYmr5PTPLzJv8RadT0Da0w5XC5NsDLxQWUXm2s6E6~MfFk-22yQZ6ZxgEU-RlOuua4mNscQTNTR3CBl0DUVd9M1aWcTZSUmL1B7Swl6Psz4Va8oU-rm4XbL0MTi8Lhg7XAXKdefaYYvQKToGKuN7d~3Mu3Lad0xKK1f-SbL6hf-xWUVQPANelN5~DV4lSE0Q__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

If you want to check both first name and last name, you'll need to set up two separate steps for each SuppressionList query, along with filters that will stop the flow if the query item is found.

**Important Note:** Most users are interested in checking to see if the lead's first or last name contains a profanity word. The temptation is to configure your SuppressionList step to check against both first and last name in one step. This won't work.

Here are two examples of step configurations that will **NOT** work:

_Example 1._

# Setup Requirements

To connect a Facebook page to LeadConduit, you have to access three different settings interfaces on Facebook, based on how your Facebook leads are managed:

1. Business Manager settings for you (if you have a Facebook Business Manager set up): you must be a full admin with access to the pages and CRMs for the pages, among other permissions.
2. Business Manager settings for the page (if you have a Facebook Business Manager set up).
3. Business Integrations under Settings on **your personal Facebook page**. Setting permissions here is necessary because you are using your personal credentials to connect LeadConduit to the page that contains your lead ads.

Your Facebook account needs to have, and authorize, "" **Manage your ads**,"" "" **Show a list of the Pages you manage**"", "" **Access Leads for your pages**"", "" **Manage accounts, settings, and webhooks for a Page**"", "" **Create and manage ads for your Page**"", "" **Read content posted on the Page**"" (formerly all included in **""Manage your Pages**"").

These permissions ensure that LeadConduit can subscribe to your Lead Ads events, process incoming leads and generate a TrustedForm for Facebook Certificate. Disabling any of these permissions may cause LeadConduit to lose access to your leads, or may cause ""Malformed Certificate"" errors when attempting to view or retain/claim TrustedForm for Facebook certificates.

# Connect a Facebook Page to LeadConduit (or Connect More Pages)

1. Open your flow editor to the Sources tab. If this is a **new flow**, please make sure to click the **Save** button now.
2. Click the **Add Source** button.
3. From the **Select a Source or Integration** section search for **Facebook** and choose the **Facebook Lead Ads Inbound Routed** integration.
4. Follow the prompts to connect LeadConduit to Facebook.
5. A list of possible pages to connect will be provided.
6. Pages connected to a different flow will include a yellow dot adjacent to the connect button.
1. If you choose to connect a page to a flow that was previously connected to a different flow, the previous connection will be broken in favor of this new connection.
2. Please Note: While one Facebook page can only be connected to a single LeadConduit flow, a single LeadConduit flow can have connections to many Facebook pages.
7. Make your connection choices and select Next.
8. You'll be prompted to confirm your changes.
9. Remember to save changes to your flow!

# Disconnect a Facebook Page from LeadConduit

1. Follow the same steps as connecting a Page, except unselect the Connected page
2. Acknowledge you are about to disconnect the page
   - Please Note: The Facebook Source will not be removed from the flow
3. Save the changes to the flow

# Standard Facebook Form Fields

LeadConduit handles most Standard Facebook form fields automatically, meaning you can connect your Facebook pages to LeadConduit and start receiving leads immediately. The two exceptions are: `work_email` and `relationship_status`. If you collect either of these fields, use the Custom Field instructions below.

If you collect any of the following fields, you only need to add them to your LeadConduit flow:

- Phone 2 (Work Phone)
- Company Name
- Country
- DOB
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Military
- Platform (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)

# Custom Facebook Form Fields

When one of your Facebook forms includes a Custom Field, there is one extra step you must take to connect the dots between Facebook Field ID and a corresponding LeadConduit Field.

The easiest way to get the Custom Field ID is to [submit a test lead](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing/) after connecting your Facebook page to LeadConduit.

Once you've submitted the test lead, find it in LeadConduit, open the Technical Details section, and search for **facebook\_field\_data\_apros**. For the following example, the Custom Field label is ""how many ads do you run in a month?""

```
""facebook_field_data_apros"": ""[{\""name\"":\""how_many_ads_do_you_run_in_a_month\"",\""values\"":[\""three\""]},{\""name\"":\""email\"",\""values\"":[\""support@activeprospecct.com\""]},{\""name\"":\""full_name\"",\""values\"":[\""HULK SMASH\""]}]""
```

Next, you'll open the flow editor to the Sources tab, find the Facebook Lead Ads source, and click the corresponding button under the **Field Mappings** header.

The left-hand value will be the LeadConduit Field receiving the lead data and the right-hand value will be the custom Facebook Field ID. Using the above  facebook\_field\_data\_apros as an example, this Source mapping will capture the value **three** to the ""Ad Type"" field for this lead:

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/535/855/original.png?f=1613155555&Expires=1748567763&Signature=vELLKk1XNhg1DCEfecx4ZIkWztZbf~tmRY4hyIK-NySOJrCIfeYjGfi5XvWB58h~JbL~dzmH-WxR4ZIp9q2MICloDGYyWMWOGr0EVF7frfIhyFKcMlV6ZaqpaDyROEpGAUN2Q2VObaisfvT32CeJ3Y6tF0NiZhGSMkiixDz2wn2xODOoCr6pKUxXh1gX4lQqp0~rhKk8Np88Q0uQw4icauJODMMJSOIQDxQIBGWIWtAoGalmHWPvZRu3p-8hvvngkVV8mlywRWUTYS3~EuwDxZaKc81m0RKOQYAbkaO83rhNlyJnGYJBl2PMptLDLHaLPZnZ4GOB4tZARCBeNs4Sww__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Paste the custom Facebook Field ID into the right-hand value field and click the **Insert {Field ID}** button.

Finally, save your flow and resubmit the lead in LeadConduit. You will now see the custom field with the rest of the lead data.

If LeadConduit is still not properly processing the custom field(s), you can chat with support within LeadConduit during business hours to resolve any field mapping issues.

# Routing Leads at a Form or Ad Level

The Facebook Router RUI only supports Page Level routing. Once a lead is received by a flow, Form and/or Ad level routing can be accomplished using flow rules.

# Disconnected Pages

LeadConduit will be automatically deauthorized from receiving leads when the individual who connected the Facebook page:

- Changes their password
- Has their access to the page revoked

To reauthenticate, you'll have to disconnect and then reconnect any affected pages, according to the instructions provided above.

# A Note on Using Facebook Business Manager

If your Business Manager has a customized Leads Access configuration, you will need to grant LeadConduit access in the CRM settings.

1. Go to [Business Manager Settings](https://business.facebook.com/settings)
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and in the left-hand field list, click Integrations, then click Lead Access
3. Locate your page in the list of pages and click it
4. Click People and confirm that you have Access
5. Click on the CRMs option and select LeadConduit Lead Ads Integration
6. Click Assign Access

More detailed instructions can be found at the [Facebook Advertiser Help Center](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1440176552713521).

# How to retain an individual TrustedForm certificate

As part of your lead management process, you will want to automate the retention of TrustedForm certificates via the TrustedForm API or via ActiveProspect's LeadConduit product. But every once in awhile, or as you're preparing your automated process, you may need to retain a certificate manually.

## The quick method to retain: Click ""Retain Certificate""

By far the easiest method to retain the certificate for future viewing is to

- Display the certificate in your browser, and
- Click ""Retain Certificate,"" the green button displayed prominently on the certificate.

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/287/028/original.png?f=1714593333&Expires=1748567764&Signature=P892ZGZLJoNbC4QGIkqt70A97sLtMjFOdVCCXfXuQlI4IwcW29xi3zj1elKoen61WeX8dzJOu3yUTXlQe9uJtqq7QUX4UC24V26S8LZNVtDT2GjCBtNoZS1kj96KL6kJyi4AL7KQtl08aUHBN9yK-NBjv87oCzM9En2k0DcQT6kqGDB247wThTQmZ45hyyR6~r5t-3CjxJkZndVnO0NpxNiaX4rUMwbTkEa1v5atlq4DHqwYGZ-XFt10qX92PfzlkXWMREoYJhnZFua1OKLwgKnw6l6KCCDjB2Q9tjO9QekLfNTAw63mB~jQ60fAy-Qy2sMttbszFY0p8BNrBrRJzA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

## Manually Retain and Perform Lead Matching

You might want to perform lead matching to make sure you confirm the email and phone that should be retained in the certificate. In order to do this, retain the certificate via one of the following methods.

To retain a certificate manually, in both of the examples given below, substitute your API key from the TrustedForm Settings instead of ""9e46a3b3c2456f33bec5ec51b7cb68"", the TrustedForm Certificate URL instead of ""[https://cert.trustedform.com/b3220852042971a00f5d05766254e6b0747e24dc](https://cert.trustedform.com/b3220852042971a00f5d05766254e6b0747e24dc?__hstc=41051389.f70ea3dd8ebe8bf10bb706a3f2138ee4.1748564165452.1748564165452.1748564165452.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564165452&__hsfp=3707738794)"", the lead's phone number instead of ""5555555555"" and the lead's email instead of ""example@gmail.com"".

A. On MacOS X:

1. Open the ""terminal"" app.

2. At the command line, substituting for the API key and TrustedForm Certificate URL, enter this and press Enter:


/usr/bin/curl-XPOST-H'Content-type:application/json'-H 'Accept: application/json' \

-u'API:9e46a3b3c2456f33bec5ec51b7cb68' -H 'api-version: 4.0' \

--data '{""retain"":{}, ""match\_lead"":{""phone"":""5555555555"", ""email"":""example@gmail.com""}}' \

https://cert.trustedform.com/b3220852042971a00f5d05766254e6b0747e24dc

Please note that the above request uses api-version of 4.0. If you have 3.0 (and please check your TrustedForm Settings to determine this) you will need to change the format slightly, making the same substitutions for email, phone, and the TrustedForm Certificate URL you want to retain:

/usr/bin/curl-XPOST-H'Content-type:application/json'-H 'Accept: application/json' \

-u'API:9e46a3b3c2456f33bec5ec51b7cb68' -H 'api-version: 3.0' \

--data '{""phone"":""5555555555"", ""email"":""example@gmail.com""}' \

https://cert.trustedform.com/b3220852042971a00f5d05766254e6b0747e24dc

B. You can use [Postman’](https://identity.getpostman.com/login)s web client on any browser and do the following:

1. After signing in, navigate to the “My Workspace” page.

2. Select the import button on the left side panel and import the Postman collection that matches your API version.
   - [Version 3.0 Collection](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1pk9ut9e8Y8l_c_UMpP7UxVAq-45iPFWk&export=download)

   - [Version 4.0 Collection](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1kaHFx1ZnSoKya_zqirzkepF8bG0kiqTK&export=download)
3. Expand “TrustedForm Certificate API” collection and select the “Retain Certificate” POST request below.

4. Enter the TrustedForm certificate URL into the labeled field next to POST.

5. Enter the lead's phone number and/or email in the labeled fields in the body section (if applicable).

6. Select the authorization tab, and enter your API key into the Password field.

7. Click the **Send** button to retain the certificate.

# TrustedForm Retain

Retain is a TrustedForm product that allows you to view and store TrustedForm certificates that can be used to prove what took place during a lead event. Use this to perform manual audits of lead generation or as evidence during lawsuits. Make sure your certificates show [prior express written consent](https://activeprospect.com/blog/tcpa-consent/) was obtained properly. If not, demand that your suppliers change their practices and only provide leads with certificates that do. All you need is a TrustedForm Certificate URL to make a simple API call that will retain the certificate in your account. If you are generating certificates you also have the option to use the [Auto-Retain](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4812756-trustedform-auto-retain-for-first-party-lead-certification) feature and make the process even easier. Use TrustedForm Retain to do the following:

- Prove how leads were created

- Audit lead generation practices

- Visually see a recreation of lead events

- And more!


**How it Works**

Ask your lead vendors to use [TrustedForm Certify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/certify/) and send a TrustedForm Certificate URL along with the lead. Then immediately use the [TrustedForm Certificate API](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Certificate-URL/) to make a request for the certificate to be retained in your account. This requires that you provide the email and/or phone number of the lead associated with the certificate in order to perform [lead matching](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4766190-trustedform-lead-matching) in attempt to make sure that the two belong together. Make sure to store the Certificate URL in your CRM or wherever your lead data is stored so that you can retrieve the correct certificate for any lead later on. Once retained, you can access that certificate from it's URL for 5 years.

# Frequently Asked Questions

# Getting Started with Facebook Custom Audiences

LeadsBridge’s Custom Audience Sync is a tool to create retargeting audiences between your CRM/platform and Facebook. It gathers information, such as email addresses and phone numbers, and keeps them always updated.

Create better Ads targeting people with specific interests and behavior. Set and forget campaigns, and use audiences mirrored with every stage of your funnel.

## Custom Audience Overview

### Custom Fields

By accessing more information from your CRM/platform, Facebook can create more profiled Custom Audiences and Lookalike Audiences to target with advertising, improving the efficiency of the Ads.

Not only you can sync basic information such as email and phone number, but also the First and Last name, Birthday, Country, Zip code, State, City, and Gender. Map as many fields as you want to achieve higher-performing data matching to people on Facebook.

### Customer Lifetime Value

Include the Lifetime Value of your clients/leads to create a value-based [Lookalike Audience](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531?id=401668390442328). That Lookalike Audience will then be made up of the people most similar to your highest-value customers, while a regular Lookalike Audience can only find people similar to all your clients/leads.

The LTV allows Facebook to focus on an audience similar to the clients who spend more money in the long run.

### Source Filter

Segment contacts by filtering them based on certain conditions. This is useful when you have big lists, or rather when you’d like to retarget only a group of people, excluding other contacts that don’t match the filter’s conditions added.

Learn more on [how to use the Source Filter](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5090356-how-to-filter-incoming-leads-on-leadsbridge) option.

### Audience Manager

Along with the Custom Audiences Sync, we introduced our manager with powerful additions:

- See the last audience size synced
- Check the _History_ of the sync processes
  - See the last execution date and time, contacts synced, added, or removed.
  - See the last error received
  - Download the CSV report of the sync
- Simulate the next run


![audience-sync](https://d3pef22pb68mhq.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/26191913/audience-sync.jpeg)

![audience-history](https://d3pef22pb68mhq.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/26191909/audience-history.jpeg)

LeadsBridge automatically detects and tries to fix errors like wrong date format, wrong column format, or wrong API responses for some specific records.

You can reap the benefits of the Custom Audience Sync in all of our plans.

# How does LeadsBridge count Facebook Custom Audiences contacts?

To count the contacts collected via Facebook [Custom Audience](https://internal.activeprospect.com/groups/55523/posts/4969955-how-to-get-started-with-custom-audiences) Bridge in LeadsBridge, we sum all the contacts synced, removed, and deleted. Let’s see an example..

You have 8000 subscribers on your Autoresponder/CRM, and you sync all of them via Facebook Custom Audience Bridge

The following day you collect additional 1000 subscribers and 200 unsubscribed from your lists.

So the total number of contacts synced via LeadsBridge is 8000 + 1000 – 200 = 8800 contacts

LeadsBridge won’t sync unsubscribed or deleted leads.

### How many contacts can I sync with LeadsBridge?

The contacts allowed to be synced from your LeadsBridge account depend [on your subscribed plan](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5039672-how-do-i-choose-the-right-leadsbridge-plan-for-me).

# Using Gravity Forms in WordPress to Submit to LeadConduit

Learn how to send leads to LeadConduit from Gravity Forms on your Wordpress site.

### 1\. Install Gravity Forms on WordPress and create your form

After obtaining your Gravity Form license, install Gravity Forms on WordPress by following the [instructions](https://docs.gravityforms.com/getting-started/#installing-gravity-forms) on their website.

Create a form by first clicking on ""Forms"" on the left pane of your WordPress Dashboard's Home page and then click **Add New**.

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/456/827/original.png?f=1610396851&Expires=1748567764&Signature=UKhiHP6sd~TkiWCX6vkH61Dk23SZS~c-OHsAh8WI-DQ5QzPyEyn~IYXfRr6D24iL29udHARbIks2PDwooU8IWH~FFCKoXkDtw-HBOh9C5tp6thdlT6i283S~B27XjE0lU5XPLW9HEfYgtO~DXU5YERwh-f1Xeg7phtETFSz6aB2vdUP8dy57dIbV0F5ARif3vVkUaWt6lvG9cn6EjPcmJYKqFV00MXYU09khps2JzHm6fcVRE3H7zQwfq9UqLpXPFtIOO5fLUOVPWj1QA6GAW7cj-U3R6VNXCdo4idwHQCk5ptWTZ8pmqO1VossIi1TEje0BsCUA4X3q9gyFPttDBQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

### 2\. Configure Gravity Forms to send leads to LeadConduit

To send lead data into LeadConduit, you will need to use the “Forms” plugin. _This step will only set LeadConduit as the location to send data; we will map the actual data being sent in the next step._

To install Forms, mouse over the **Plugins** button on the left pane of your WordPress site and select **Add New**. Type in “forms 3rd Party” and you will find the “Forms: 3rd-Party Integration” in the list. Install and activate the plugin.

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/456/838/original.png?f=1610397030&Expires=1748567764&Signature=VxuySremGy6Ecf7ziIUQ0uHgbF-nonFde8t5rADhXe0vYYmX4ya9XTiabk2fO7q94ARF3ZE-zqPRzcYvbhDrfir7NWl9G7wrpHh1xuycpXiC7zFGWoOn1vqCBEn1Z6uPlB2VPf6VYk47pOW6543ApsKXlPiqb4oYogqE8-ldq2kD5fMeAgaAIumhqhyXNswWy4rC90ZFYiHLXJf7WaMex5SHluIEpswG1NSlQ3~hk5O2InuSNSBJFf45KSYXxQxnPHfGmMZDnBdMXwbvHx0ZVulecPAwOjgDmhw5eJabRXmoHzgreFMHvuGcsSOcmTyR3oPJzUnwyaywYxKWI1lkkw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

**3\. Set the location to which the Forms integration will send lead data.**

Mouse over **Forms** and click on **3rdparty Services** in the expanded menu. In the **3rd-Party Service: Forms Test** section, find the Submission URL box. This is where you will enter your LeadConduit posting URL, found in your [Submission Docs](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4109880-finding-and-using-submission-docs).

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/456/844/original.png?f=1610397242&Expires=1748567764&Signature=LjXzlwfoOL0p28tn8t-1tD8FAFdY7cxuJAiAzatPTmi1djB75FmNwv6xN3zuMpTXKWIuJdfEugqZoFDBkEyeInAKBZ5vhKpNMfK9A7yS0ZYaHHFsQbALxL~DYlGp8SnZmrU~SNZmKqe-h98TGc3gyjtnYS6BjCgaZ-BvcAo5uoKwlcFwUBa6RsTQxaixIzLK6a2WM5CowK5R2PJwlHyvV74PL~GIGmlOkA8PsjiYkZAfQuq28l~ersj4LRp~LDxNJldW8JBlz-pijJDA8WGgHGlzpATucZvQGlhmArhJPVnPoK2lvL7BV9RG~Rg4ZBUOb1fnaHKYZrNrot-4rtmFyw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

**4\. Map your Gravity Form fields to LeadConduit fields**

Gravity Forms now knows _where_ to send the lead data, but the form fields must still must be properly mapped, so you will need to map the Gravity Form fields to send data to LeadConduit fields.

Scroll down and find the **Mapping** subsection. Here you will map the form’s fields (the Form Submission Field) to LeadConduit flow field labels (3rd-Party Field). The LeadConduit flow field labels can be found in your [Submission Docs](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4109880-finding-and-using-submission-docs).

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/456/858/original.png?f=1610397344&Expires=1748567764&Signature=Z8hFUbzipklXHJCMH54FbS8kgefJZunUf7CjcYB7htUb-fb~39JquYtaAqi7MTgEmVQwC6vwD-neajcUGk6edwraFb-PAwx6fDoutwlY~PeVFpchnl35rjvnoUOEQFrhdSq6ynItPHxTRfmfiN6uNNevLty5rghgBdZgx~DMQxbeWAs7~7OgUdt7Hq78MmZQAKmx4AwcMNlQztAx-FhGo2ZmwqzaZcU9Cyw~wWw5epkTN4g3eMIC27ET91dvCeUaq4X1zhZi1oF8SRYWxHbf6W5uRf2IIIrC48hXArWkbA9VlaZwkcy9J4oOGLuCAxdOGqQzgB7-mNuzgVpgqEyWmQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Keep in mind that the third-party plug-in is only capable of sending data if the form element’s [input name](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_name.asp) has a single “\_” prefix. For example, where \`input\_18\` would be acceptable, \`input\_18.1\` would not be. For this reason, we suggest the use of form element types like “Single Line Entry” and “Radio Button,” as their input names follow the acceptable syntax.

**Your Gravity Form is now ready to send lead data to LeadConduit.** If you’d like to configure more than one form for lead submission to LeadConduit, click the “Add Another Service” button at the bottom of the mapping menu and repeat this process.

# Verify Domain Ownership

Verify your domains in your ActiveProspect Account to start gaining domain specific insights.

### Why Verify?

As a site-owner generating TrustedForm certificates, we want to provide you insights into domain specific certificate volume and give you credit for TrustedForm certificates claimed from your domains. To do that, all you have to do is verify you are the domain owner.

Verifying ownership of domains and sub-domains where you have implemented the TrustedForm Script, lets us positively verify that you created a lead associated with the TrustedForm Certificate.

Once your domain is added, no other account can claim ownership of that domain.

### Verification Process

The process of verifying your domains is simple; we generate a unique code per domain that you add to your domain's dns record and we check for a match in the background.

### 1\. Add your domains to ActiveProspect Account

1. Navigate to the Domain section in [My Account](https://account.activeprospect.com/domains) (if you do not see a Domains, please talk to your admin, this is a permission setting)
2. Select Add Domains
3. List all domains you want to verify
1. If you are verifying subdomains, you can individually add and verify subdomains. Or you can just add the root domain and you'll have an option in step 2 to verify all subdomains.

### 2\. Get your verification code from ActiveProspect Account

1. Under Actions, select the Verify Ownership link for the domain you are ready to verify
2. Copy the unique code

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/944/170/original.png?f=1745956313&Expires=1748567764&Signature=KwE0mFuPBcDNIex0c3t0Maeh2nO~UhgrJ28m4OVjYGl8kGif2cNfjG0bgpFT9Dln~5n8QxZv2OVt8Us2VONO1XjmCuc6X-wSEhPx9hkez~yesUCGStKEjK-xq8eKQhP3Mfah1FL0CFFU3OMANAZ6uXOi8FyvZiafO8uMC5-nTDYkHZd9LQyvG3iTlo4EyiQ0Kq8zJ2xYK2tZ8qkJRjiai19H~19PIwGRLjsuYynAY0xjXKZRhFKx-A2EEkleP6k~lzPc81nPUGNuiD~9ays8OzsHhtuX~3IRo3KEO0yyGIdCEX1wy-KmdBTF9zb97kuws~-~PZ5Ee6i15N95vpmd~w__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

### 3\. Add a TXT record in your domain's DNS registrar

1. In a second browser window or tab, sign in to your domain's DNS registrar/host
2. Go to your domain’s DNS records. The page might be called something like DNS Management, Name Server Management, Control Panel, or Advanced Settings.
3. Select the option to add a new TXT record
1. If you're verifying an individual subdomain, you'll want to add the TXT record to the root domain in your DNS. If you're verifying multiple subdomains for one root domain, your root domain should have multiple TXT records.
4. In the TXT record, set the unique code as the value/answer/destination (the field names vary based on your registrar).

### 4\. (Optional) Verify all subdomains - NEW

If you're verifying a root domain, you'll see an option to also verify all subdomains (STEP 3). If this is selected and auto-retain is enabled for the root domain, auto-retain will also be enabled for **all** subdomains.

_**This will also be reflected under the 'Auto Retain Confirmed Domains' section in [TrustedForm Certify tab](https://app.trustedform.com/certificates/issue?__hstc=41051389.ae54412870ba112d988a98919d458305.1734639748363.1745983592484.1745987807012.301&__hssc=41051389.5.1745987807012&__hsfp=4052119064), as follows:**_

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/944/754/original.png?f=1745989144&Expires=1748567764&Signature=sdZqYxhRAGlOcPCOVhO43BORI3M2ybT8z3F3b5LA-jj4F~kElPLqQ1HUBLS-jiPSJ9pHeATqesR8AgOoq-LvJvrdcux5XvO46qpEjwTUKIxhM1MAAxAuUBAOHR7mJyzQY7Jhq1egDb4~kiqgK3awVssZRnReF7PZ4w4QzbhCgAaf9TChj4ulDZ1~WY2nqUWvWWgrOrd-Q4l4HOnceIsKm487RMZ3UavBFBwr1nInx0AG~KFyzS2L1w8gq-BdP2PhLxQ6Q4XXR-FQIt7Cv0MXp87Wh6avsizAimD1V~-r8fIowobqy9PpIAjVR~RL5RsVigeWsHAA54gsFXAmTSE3pA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

**_Subdomain Ownership Statuses Explained:_**

- **Confirmed:** This status appears when the option to also verify all subdomains is checked for the given domain. Ownership of subdomains is confirmed.
- **Unconfirmed:** This status appears when ownership of subdomains has not been confirmed (the option to also verify all subdomains is not checked).
- **N/A:** This status appears when the domain itself is a subdomain. Subdomain ownership confirmation is not applicable here because the option to verify subdomains only applies to root domains.

### 5\. Tell ActiveProspect Account to check your verification code

1\. Navigate back to your ActiveProspect Account tab, and select Begin Verification. Once selected, we will star the process of verifying your domain.

2\. Refresh the page to check for updated ownership status

### Do you have a CNAME record on the domain you want to verify?

CNAME records are common for subdomains and TXT records can't be added to domains with CNAME records. If you're verifying a subdomain, add the TXT record to the root domain. If you're verifying multiple subdomains, your root domain can have multiple TXT records (one for each subdomain).

### Domain Statuses

Once you have initiated the verification process, we will continuously check and update the domain status until you remove the domain.

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/147/093/original.png?f=1648485804&Expires=1748567764&Signature=mcWxv~Iz9zwoXRFanyQCumglqQQ3aPglU2xybrf8OX-sI-Ihq3Ukz~Q6lmkIbqbEkvceDlVJnmk5x8yVBrh-7zpdE1uG7Ja3DjoCmIfJFhqEXSPfq7zDGUhNn5unvNEUSJ~cgtt5bloUKVoPupwbeGqlxCx2XTcNuxHMl0sYvQVTZaSjPJl~o605gs-T4n0lSEHod-PlK96BKdjEyajBwBWkJ3LTfc9tYfdxcXv6KzBMQ6OBoI19r2V5pwO9pr-qa-MpqTdku0F96N7y0mYjfgkDwKdIjTeNM3bLFjgxV7aGCYDqY-IOeLzHPDJkJ3~Xz0RwOO76O9DSq0FNHxPthg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Ownership Status:  represents the current status of the domain. Refresh the page to see the most up-to-date ownership statuses.

Last Checked: timestamp of the last time we checked the verification status of the domain (every time we attempt a verification)

Last Verified:  timestamp of the last successful verification of the domain

### Ownership Status Reasons Explained

- **Verified**: You have proved ownership of the domain! We successfully matched the unique code with your domain's dns record
- **Unverified**: We have not proved ownership of the domain.
  - Ownership not yet verified: you have not started the verification process for this domain
  - Verification pending: you have initiated the verification process but we have not yet verified ownership
  - Code Not Found: you have begun the verification process but no code is found on the dns record.
  - Connection error: there has been a timeout. If an already verified domain receives a connection error, then we will retry verification 10 times using exponential backoff. After 10 connection errors, the domain will be marked as unverified.
  - Domain not found: Domain doesn't exist
  - Code not found: We successfully checked the domain, but there was not a TXT record with the correct code

### Troubleshooting Tips:

- We run a domain verification check in the background at different cadences once you have started the verification process for a specific domain
  - We check **unverified** domains every 5 minutes.
  - We check **verified** domains once a day at midnight (Central Standard Time)
- If the ""Last Checked"" and ""Last Verified"" timestamps are different, the verification has failed.  Meaning, we did not receive a successful verification when last checked.
- A domain is marked unverified if it hasn't been verified in three days.
  - The ownership status will stay verified for a 3 day grace period, if after 3 days of attempts to reverify the ownership status successfully, the verified status will change to unverified with a reason. This grace period is to provide time for you to make planned updates to your domain records and not have your ownership status impacted.
- The Ownership Status - \[reason\] will provide information for you to investigate possible causes of the change in verification status.
- Domains rarely become unverified, common reasons that ownership status changes from verified to unverified;
  - the code is deleted from the TXT record answer
  - loss of ownership of the domain
- If you delete the code in the TXT record answer, all you need to do is re-add the same code back in. No need to generate a new domain code in your ActiveProspect Account.
- Make sure to verify your sub-domains if you wish to auto claim from those domains.
- Only users with the permission, ""Manage user and domains for this account"" will be able to see and manage domains. If you need permissions, please contact your account admin or [support@activeprospect.com](mailto:support@activeprospect.com)





**FAQ**
1. **Can I use the \`verify all subdomains\` checkbox if I’ve already verified some subdomains individually?**
     - Yes. If you have already verified subdomains and then use the \`verify all subdomains\` checkbox on your root domain, it will be duplicative, but that's alright. You can choose to delete the individual subdomains and the related TXT records from your DNS, but it’s not required.
2. **Does the TXT record now only need to exist on the root domain?**
     - The TXT record used to confirm ownership, whether for the root domain or a subdomain, should be placed on the root domain in your DNS. But now, with the \`verify all subdomains\` checkbox, you only need to add your root domain, grab the single TXT record, and add it to the root domain’s DNS entry. This avoids having multiple TXT records on the root domain for different subdomains.
3. **Will the \`verify all subdomains\` checkbox include verification of sub-domains of a sub-domain?**
     - Yes, it should confirm ownership of all subdomains under the root domain. For example, if the root domain is example.com, then both blog.example.com and shop.blog.example.com would be covered.
4. If I’ve already verified my root domain, do I just need to check the box to \`verify all subdomains\`, or is there more to it?
     - That’s correct, you just need to enable the \`verify all subdomains\` checkbox and save. No additional steps are required.

# TrustedForm Retain: Using the Auto-Retain method to store certificates for first party leads

Automatically retain your TrustedForm Certificates generated from your verified domains without making an API request

Are you struggling to set up an integration to retain TrustedForm Certificates for the leads you generated? Do you wish that you could simply store all the certificates for leads from your websites? If so, then you should use TrustedForm's new solution designed to help you store proof of consent for first-party leads.

Traditionally, our users have always had to make an API request to retain TrustedForm Certificates. This gave technical users a lot of flexibility to integrate this step however they want but created a challenge for those who don't have the experience or resources to develop a process to do this. TrustedForm Auto-Retain seeks to make it easy for anyone to retain proof of consent for the leads they generate.

# How It Works

TrustedForm Auto-Retain works in conjunction with the TrustedForm Certify Web SDK to recognize when a lead is submitted on your website and automatically stores that lead's TrustedForm Certificate to your account. You can set up this process in a just a few steps:

1. **Verify your domains**

In order to know which certificates we should retain in your account, you must prove you own the domain they are generated from. Simply follow the instructions in the [Verify Domain Ownership](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4649879-verify-domain-ownership) guide so that you will have the ability to enable TrustedForm Auto-Retain for them.
2. **Open the TrustedForm application**

Auto-Retain can be enabled on the [Issuing Certificates page of the TrustedForm application](https://app.trustedform.com/certificates/issue). Scroll to the bottom, and you will see a section marked ""Auto-Retain Confirmed Domains.![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/944/769/original.png?f=1745994393&Expires=1748567765&Signature=KVXsQ-wR-76kqO4C7LnYTz~k8~wPQTkpmTuewwwa9JqVy4nSi-NXYW0ipv8xncq7sZHETstqrBm8FWsfE0cNJ1yVEHiFXv47Zec5BctepWPB1JAfx5SMnY7pQTGpaYh-q0eb139DpkjHXW~-Z2WdeE3dlpg9gZueuTfshiNC5mQ8WMG4w6a~sXTnvp1Lr~y2kUzHd5V4Zi56g9irPz-Yy77p4NZa1rJzmEh~fsNO1sWdBPegk-vT8BxkOf2A6y-oU3~FG~6iFNPZURi2VLog0L4r0Nk~MgEWUi-Nwi9JeCWhd2Q2-zuySocFeJ80173g2lY-RsulW6K3Nc5rafxgSw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)
3. **Enable Auto-Retain** Toggle the Auto Retain switch to 'Enabled' next to each of your verified domains to confirm that you would like to retain all certificates for the leads generated from them. Once Auto Retain is enabled, the switch will update to give you the option to disable it if needed.

If your account has not been configured to use Auto-Retain, you will see a message with instructions on how to proceed so that you can be provided access.



_(New Update) If the **'Subdomain Ownership Status'** is **'Unconfirmed'**, follow the instructions in [Verify Domain Ownership](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4649879-verify-domain-ownership?_gl=1*zqdwg8*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NDU2MDAxMjguQ2owS0NRandoWVNfQmhEMkFSSXNBSlRNTVFiaXRYMkdhRFdWemNDYW0wOFJtNXpFNzRLbHpuVEtxMkxjWV9JN2VIRU5wcGZJZFo1dzFOb2FBb2VXRUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_au*MTI0OTE0OTIxNS4xNzQ0NjM5NjA2LjY1MDQxMjc5OC4xNzQ1ODc5MTYxLjE3NDU4NzkxODE.*_ga*NTQ3NjI0NDQxLjE3MzQ2Mzk3NDQ.*_ga_QHXBV6N7D1*MTc0NTk4Nzc4Ny4xODEuMS4xNzQ1OTkzNjA2LjQ1LjAuNDE0MTA2MzQw) to complete the subdomain verification process (optional). Once the status is set to 'Confirmed' and Auto-retain is enabled, then auto-retain will be enabled for the root domain and **all associated** subdomains._

# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **How do I know that Auto-Retain is working?**

After a lead is **submitted\*** to your website, wait at least 15 minutes and then visit the TrustedForm Certificate URL for that lead. If you are able to view the full certificate, it has been successfully retained your account. It will also appear in your [recent stored certificates](https://app.trustedform.com/claims). You should also monitor your usage on the TrustedForm home page as any sudden increases/decreases could indicate an issue. Reach out to [support@activeprospect.com](mailto:support@activeprospect.com) if your certificates are not being retained.

_**\*Please note there must be a form submission for auto-retain to work.**_

2. **Do I have to store the TrustedForm Certificate URL with the lead?**

Yes, we always recommend storing the TrustedForm Certificate URL in a CRM or similar system alongside all other lead data. In the future, we will release features to help you find certificates without knowing the URL, but it is always a best practice to maintain a record of it.

3. **Will Auto-Retain be included in my current allotment/volume?**

No, Auto-Retain is tracked separately from other methods of storing certificates. Please consult your specific pricing specifications for details.

4. **If I use Auto-Retain will my lead buyers be able to access/view my certificates?**

No, in order for your lead buyers to gain access to view your certificates you must first provide them with the TrustedForm Certificate URL. Then they will have to use the TrustedForm API to retain the certificate in their own account.

5. **If I already use other TrustedForm products, is there an additional cost to use Auto-Retain?**

Auto-Retain is a feature of the Retain product offering. Usage of it will be billed as Retain First Party on your invoice based on your rate.

6. **Will the certificates retained via the Auto-Retain product be used when generating the dashboard that appears on the TrustedForm home page?**

Yes, the TrustedForm home page shows aggregate information pertaining to all the certificates retained in your account regardless of which product was used to do so.

7. **If I use Auto-Retain how can I also use TrustedForm Insights on these certificates?**

TrustedForm Insights is an API product which operates separately from TrustedForm Auto-Retain. Although the two can be used in conjunction, TrustedForm Insights requires its own setup with your development team or through a third party integration. Read the [TrustedForm Insights](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4709758-trustedform-insights) article for more information.

8. **What happens to my certificates where TrustedForm Certify doesn't detect a form submission event?**

Any certificates where a form submission is not detected will not be stored to your account as this normally indicates the consumer did not become a lead and does not want to be marketed to. They will expired 3 days after creation and be deleted. If you believe an error has occurred and desire to retain these certificate you will have to do so using the [TrustedForm Certificate API](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/getting-started/).

9. **How does TrustedForm Certify detect form submission events?**

**TrustedForm Certify listens for events that explicitly indicate a form has been submitted or are associated with elements on a page that behave like a submit button. The script is expected to accurately capture these submit events from any webpage using a standard <form> tag with a submit button embedded inside of it.**

# Common Issues with Facebook Lead Ads

When using Facebook integration on LeadsBridge, you may come across some known and easy-to-fix errors. We’ll explain how to troubleshoot these and get everything back on track.

### **Custom Audience Facebook Error (TOS)**

To fix it, it's necessary to accept the TOS by clicking on the **Accept TOS** button inside LeadsBridge.

You’ll then be redirected to Facebook Custom Audience GUI to accept them, or you can follow this link: [https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager/audiences/manage/](https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager/audiences/manage/)

Please note that the **TOS should be accepted for every Facebook Ads account separately.**

### **LeadsBridge App Permissions**

LeadsBridge should have all of the app permissions enabled to work properly on your account. To make sure they’re enabled, just follow the steps below:

1. Log into your Facebook Account
2. Go to **Settings** » **Business Integrations**
3. Click on **View and edit** under **LeadsBridge** to modify its permissions

[Make sure to give all the permissions to the LeadsBridge App](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5070199-why-are-leads-not-pushed-in-real-time-from-facebook-lead-ads-to-my-crm) and click on **Save**.

### **Multi Hashes**

This is an error message that comes directly from Facebook and it says:

_“Failed to update the custom audience: **This audience was created from data source** FILE\_IMPORTED.MULTI\_HASHES, **which does not support data source** FILE\_IMPORTED.HASHES\_OR\_USER\_IDS.”_

It means that the creation method of the Audience doesn’t match the update method on LeadsBridge. Basically, this error comes up when you try to update an Audience previously created from another platform or with a manual upload on Facebook.

To fix this, you should create a new Custom Audience inside LeadsBridge, which will then be automatically updated. If you wish to use an already created Custom Audience as well for your advertisement, you may select both of them when setting up your campaigns.

### The Facebook test didn’t come into my CRM

The _[test@fb.com](mailto:test@fb.com)_ is a fake lead that is not accepted by a lot of autoresponders/CRMs and this could be the reason why you don’t see it inside your platform.

Please follow these steps to insert a lead with real data:

1. Click here [https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing).
2. Choose your Facebook Page where you want to insert the test lead
3. Click on the **Delete lead** button
4. Click on **Preview form** (DO NOT CLICK ON **Create lead** BUTTON)

5\. Insert any valid email and data

6\. Click on **Submit**

Basically, you need to use the [**Lead Ads Testing Tool**](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5073014-facebook-lead-ads-how-do-i-send-a-test-lead-from-facebook) provided by Facebook to insert a test lead that you will use to verify that everything works great.

## Error validating access token: user changed the password

The following error shows up when the password for the account has been changed, as it stops LeadsBridge from accessing it:

- _“Api \[190\] “(FacebookResponseException) \[190\] Error validating access token: the user has changed the password”_
- _“(FacebookResponseException) \[10\] (#10) To use ‘Page Public Content Access’, your use of this endpoint must be reviewed and approved by Facebook”_

To fix this you should **Reauthorize** the **Ad Account** from which you have changed the password.

Check [this guideline](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5075230-how-can-i-reauthorize-my-facebook-ad-account) on _How to reauthorize your Facebook Ad Account._

## **Lead not pushed in real-time from Facebook Lead Ads**

There’s a well-known issue with the Facebook Business Manager. The following guideline will help you set the correct permissions inside the Business Manager: [https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5070199-why-are-leads-not-pushed-in-real-time-from-facebook-lead-ads-to-my-crm](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5070199-why-are-leads-not-pushed-in-real-time-from-facebook-lead-ads-to-my-crm)

## **(FacebookResponseException) \[100\], \[200\] or \[278\]**

If you get one of the following error messages:

- “( _FacebookResponseException) \[100\] Unsupported get request. Object with ID ‘….’ does not exist_“
- “ _(FacebookResponseException) \[200\] (#200) To subscribe to the leadgen field, one of these permissions is needed: leads\_retrieval_“
- _“(FacebookResponseException) \[278\] (#278) Reading advertisements requires an access token with the extended permission ads\_read”_

You should check which is the Ad Account that returns this error by going to the **Ad Accounts** section of LeadsBridge.

It could be that the Ad Account has expired or some information has been changed on the Facebook side.

To fix this, you should **Reauthorize** the Ad Account involved. Check [this guideline](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5075230-how-can-i-reauthorize-my-facebook-ad-account) on _How to reauthorize your Facebook Ad Account._

## Why do I have to enable Two Factor Authentication?

If you get the following error message:

- _Facebook Permission Error. The Facebook Page you’re trying to connect has Two Factor Authentication enabled._

This means that the Facebook Page, or the Business Manager to which the Page belongs, has Two Factor Authentication enabled. In order to solve this issue, you should enable Two Factor Authentication in your Ad Account and then follow the Reauthorization process. Check [this guideline](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5075230-how-can-i-reauthorize-my-facebook-ad-account) on _How to reauthorize your Facebook Ad Account._

**Why my Facebook Page isn’t showing up inside the bridge?**

If you can’t see the _Facebook Page_ inside the bridge setup, it means that your connection is outdated. In order to update it, you should **re-authorize** your _Facebook Ad Account_ following [this guideline](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5075230-how-can-i-reauthorize-my-facebook-ad-account).

Once done, your _Facebook Page_ will show up on the drop-down.

## Why can’t I see my Facebook Form under the Facebook step?

To be able to manage _Ad Forms_ and related leads, the Facebook Page containing the Ad Forms must be managed by **at least** one _Business Manager_.

Users also have to be managed within the _Business Manager_ of the Facebook Account that is being used. The Page that is used should also be assigned to that user.

If you aren’t able to see the list of Ad Forms inside LeadsBridge as shown below, you could have one of the following cases:

1. The _Facebook Account_ isn’t associated with a _Business Manager_
2. The _Facebook Page_ isn’t associated with a _Business Manager_
3. The _Facebook Account_’s user ( _People_) isn’t associated with the _Facebook Page_ inside the _Business Manager_

To troubleshoot the above issue, we suggest following these steps:

1. Create a _Business Manager_ associated with your _Facebook Account_
2. [Add the _Page_](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/720478807965744?helpref=faq_conten) to at least one _Business Manager_
3. [Connect your _Account_](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/166896210924641?helpref=faq_content)( _People_) to the _Facebook Page_ within the _Business Manager_


The _Page_ that you want to manage inside LeadsBridge needs to be included in **at least** one _Business Manager_ associated with the _Facebook Account_. The same _Page_ should also be assigned to the _Account_ which is used inside the Bridge.

## Why can’t I see my Facebook Campaign Name?

First of all, [make sure your Campaign is activated on the Facebook side](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/650774041651557?id=649869995454285). The Delivery column of the Ads Manager is where you can check the status of your Campaigns and find information about any problems.

When your Campaign is active, you’re able to see more information about its delivery (it's active when the toggle switch is blue). When your Campaign is deactivated, it shows as Off status in the Delivery column, and the Campaign Name won't be triggered in LeadsBridge.

## **Why do I receive the Campaign ID instead of the Campaign Name?**

If you receive the _Campaign ID_ instead of the _Campaign Name_ is because the _Ad Form_ connected to the bridge is associated with a _Campaign_ owned by another _Ad Account_ and not by the one connected to the bridge.

This happens because the _Campaign_ is associated with a single _Ad Account_, while the _Ad Form_ could be visible from different _Ad Accounts_ because the _Ad Form_ is related to a Facebook _Page_.

In this case, the best practice is to use a single _Ad Account_ for a _Campaign_ and _Ad Form_.

If you are using the Facebook Account connection with LeadsBridge, please ensure your Facebook Business Account is connected to the correct Facebook Ad Account.

Please refer to our community article to [authorize my Facebook Ad Account](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5075230-how-do-i-reauthorize-my-facebook-ad-account).

# How to setup Facebook Conversion API?

Facebook Conversions API (or Server-Side API) is designed to help businesses maintain data privacy while delivering personalized experiences to their customers without relying on browser-based tools like cookies.

Additionally, Conversions API provides businesses:

- **Full funnel visibility:** it offers businesses the ability to share a wider array of data with us currently captured by Pixel. This gives businesses full-funnel visibility.

- **Accurate data sharing:** data sharing through Conversions API is more accurate than other methods; businesses don’t have to worry about data getting lost because of a browser crash or an ad blocker.

- **Data control:** Conversions API gives businesses more control over what they share. That means businesses that implement the Conversions API can decide what to share and when to share it.


LeadsBridge will send anonymized data to Facebook using the SHA-256 algorithm. By design, LeadsBridge will not store any sensitive data in its database.

LeadsBridge only acts as a “hub” or “middle-ware” that retrieves the information from your data warehouse (e.g. CRM, etc.), validates the information, and push to Facebook using their API.

In this guide, you’ll learn how to create a Bridge between your Facebook Conversions API and your CRM.

A **Bridge** is a word we use to describe a connection between a Source, in this case, your CRM, and a Destination, in this case, your Facebook Conversions API.

Facebook Conversions API lets you:

- **Measure customer actions in more ways.** For example, you can share delayed values, user scores, or lead scores and use them for optimization in our other business tools.

- **Improve reliability to send events for measurement and optimization when used along with the pixel.** The Conversions API will help capture events that you may lose due to poor network connectivity or long page load times.

- **Control the data you share.** You can include more meaningful data about your users, such as their user scores, alongside the event data you share with Facebook via the Conversions API.


This can help you better understand the ROI of your advertising and allows you to optimize for the outcome that matters most to your business.

After you finish your Bridge setup, LeadsBridge will start automatically syncing your data, retrieving them from your CRM, and keeping them synced with your Facebook account.

## Conversions API step-by-step setup

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/783/260/original.png?f=1688731452&Expires=1748567763&Signature=aMN6Ku4EXtuA-Dp~NB6zdoSDs~bzFhz8Ft2r-pIcYGdiQr5u7ZtD56lfmxRfOGeTkg70P~A3gAqCCvjw-J2YFqBnNX8bN~QRCNms6nspAfvCeSsoQs4Vxkb2toTEzYyxHrXZnjuiVBQcUmVBnhZKi5f3D9mxC9PansHGtdW7AFH1nFYas9bDyvir7dKLS3KYlIeVBgyTvhBK-y0dOGlbpwLoOOs3qOCtTzUDStz6u5bKg~4tLRYwiCYTrFsb8SW2CRVL6QUkRZOs1JJf5dQirXltDbdVTnpgYnudyLeotWJWy15znJAQBkQD3~Du5xHMSIj005rhpb9wwBNPhS3-KQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

### **1\. Select the source**

This is the first part of the **Sources** step; in this step, you should select the CRM or Platform from which LeadsBridge will retrieve your data.

For these guidelines, we will use _Salesforce_ and create a new _Salesforce_ Integration. Still, you can use any of the hundreds of integrations available in LeadsBridge (e.g. _SFDC_, _HubSpot_, _SFTP_, _Database_, _CSV files_).

After we have selected our Integration, we can select the **Destination** settings.

### **2\. Integration setup**

This is the **Integration** step; in this step, you will create the connection with your CRM by clicking **Create a new integration**, in this case, Salesforce. You can click on **Authorize** to set the connection between _Salesforce_ and LeadsBridge.

Since we are using _Salesforce_, you set set some integration options such as **Use sandbox?**

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/783/273/original.png?f=1688731863&Expires=1748567763&Signature=r7FOjbxi828ZKKrqcnYEObqFzVp9mQm5QfCErm0gjqf0fC1Z6qGlgOYQRRZxtody18pku6X~yJIOOdga9piWEnCK2jQS5~XX~2uuE-1ZuI1iMLHOkDXBLRLb4T3iqY94WvnDt6Z3wKZ7TqJPxTpmI0y68Elpbs9fLj0Xe4YNVLqJCRUIZj~tr35bDhZTKxuHuW~lCoSHxigR1qSqDzK1RPl8MqIsEHfJ17HihntFdablI9JY4zgQYNrBv-Yd7ShcMOJ5ig8Yb2E46jEb-tkjWrH12dz~Huhn3PIs6kgKkOTzbnR2MVwndjpQ-FBIp2vQd5JCJv7sC4gtOEs4XuZbXg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

If you have already created your Integration, you can jump to the next step.

The parameters may vary according to the Integration you’re using. You should type your Integration name and confirm it. So, you will be redirected to the bridge.

### **3\. Source setup**

This is the second part of the **Sources** step; in this step, you can select the type of segmentation concept you want to use while retrieving the selected Source objects. For example, if you choose _Salesforce_, LeadsBridge will retrieve your _List Views_, which is a _Salesforce_ segmentation concept.

After that, in the **Manage ”Objects“ as** dropdown, you should choose the kind of object you want to retrieve from Salesforce. If, for instance, your business uses the _Salesforce Opportunity_, please select that option in the dropdown. Otherwise, if you want to keep the _Leads_ or _Contacts_ from your websites synced, choose those kinds of objects.

Then, in the **Use ”Segment“ as** dropdown, you should choose the type of segmentation concept you would like to use when retrieving your Integration objects. Since we are using _Salesforce_, we may select **List Views** as a segment to receive the contacts that belong to a specific _List. For_ instance, let’s say that you have a specific _List View_ that contains all the contacts that showed _Interest_ when being reached by your call center.

### **4\. Account information**

This is the **Destination** step; in this step, you need to select the System User you want to connect to. When the Bridge is ready, LeadsBridge can periodically sync and update your CRM data with your Facebook Conversions API.

Initially, you’ll need to connect to LeadsBridge the Facebook Ad Account that you’ll be using in your Campaigns, and create a System User.

1. Select the _System User_ that you previously created from the dropdown. Alternatively, click on the **Create a new Integration** button and select the Business Manager you want to create the System User. LeadsBridge will attempt the System User creation for you.

2. Now, on the Facebook side, follow these steps:

1. Go into **Business Manager Settings**: [https://business.facebook.com/settings](https://business.facebook.com/settings ""https://business.facebook.com/settings"")
2. Select your Business Manager
3. From the left menu, select **Data Sources** and then **Pixels**
4. Select the Pixel you want to connect to CAPI (e.g. “My Facebook Pixel”) and click on the **Add People** button
5. Select **LeadsBridge\_SystemUser** (which has been created at the end of step 5 above) and tick **Manage Pixel**
6. Click **Assign** to save and submit

[![](https://d3pef22pb68mhq.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/13165111/a0d83d92-e3a4-491d-961c-dce84a07ade8-800x377.png)](https://d3pef22pb68mhq.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/08121529/fe62a6f2-a211-445c-830e-3fe38af2da10-300x141.png)

Now that you have connected the Facebook Ad Account and created the System User, we can proceed with the bridge configuration steps.

### **5\. Pixel settings**

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/783/284/original.png?f=1688732456&Expires=1748567763&Signature=I7npao4Yrgv9FppCJaz7p36hOGBg9iICPC4j-kLaHLeran1iJrVqY1o4~evPEDN-GRwYQ1pWys59B5wKLA9N9Jqy7E3nJWOqUCioG-ALk1wYBp1mwTxptsSxWv-5sXZbfnU7ZdOrtWOLwKAIirYbppKdql31rxuSBcDkVtYaQw-C~9lBMovjEgtIhSzevQ~Fs6Cw5AGziHECSiEzblysJSD0aiS0S0BG01g75LpMtI0Xj161k686KYfiAMDnPfGMb2~5hVlNkvNTnHxvOwa1PUy7CtaAi5i1FS9tl6msSKa0CMeb7TzC33gN~fmpkAZt~V9NDhCDNhaIUgFTCDjcVw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

This is the first part of the **Settings** step; in this step, you should select the **Pixel** to which you want to send your data.

1. In the **Pixel** dropdown, choose between creating a new Conversions API or select one that you’ve previously created.

2. Under the **Sync Each** dropdown, you should define the Sync frequency you would like to use; we recommend using the _24-hour_ sync frequency.

3. Then, in the **Start Sync At** dropdown, you may choose at which specific time of the day you would like to start the syncing process; we advise you to leave it as _Automatically Detected_.

4. If you are ingesting conversions without a specific value, we suggest flagging the default conversion value to 1 and the default conversions currency to USD.

5. In this last selection option, you may set your Bridge on **Live Sync** and start sending your data into your Facebook Pixel, or set it as **Simulation** and allow LeadsBridge to elaborate and validate your source data, excluding the syncing process. Thanks to this latter option, you will be able to double-check the information sent to Facebook when you set the Bridge on **Live Sync** mode.

6. Finally, click on the **Continue** button

### **6\. Source Filter**

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/783/289/original.png?f=1688732753&Expires=1748567764&Signature=WANe1df9IwHx8AmPbNNQ9EluEN4Qd1bWVKmtA2wEiWsNc6AXMj0wVF3iNEKF9UQtdyK1EpergpDE26MjL2gduA9Nw9uxEqRoyJ6fYVJJTE9iSNhjD7kMYMmBjPh7oq0LsooOCtzlMvLeYut~M0Nvbqf-tHUa2N4Es7bPqzwMYZz2XrYLDuQqgcr3UtYBVxSZOecKfX684b-M01Q7uDfn1G4PFC03JSufS8oKlVfVDLBdivTR9I11WXmPQICQS1LQw5BkIXZ6~ASOVanRmCZfT8KCGBi~fQ9QQwZZkHjsM8PAyeq20L2NNckt8kjyMMIg0K~WjjA7wg0VkUEZyLxC3w__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Also, if you click on **Add Filter for Incoming Leads**, you will define **Conditions** on which you can set further segmentation filters for your contacts. In this way, you may allow contacts to be sent into your Facebook Pixel based on some conditions like, for instance, a filter that will only allow the syncing of contacts that have been assigned a specific _State_ or _Stage_ in your CRM.

After you have selected your _Segmentation_ and optionally assigned your _Source Filter_, you can click on **Save Changes** to continue with the following step.

### **7\. Fields Mapping**

This is the **Fields Mapping** step, and it is the most important part of the Bridge creation. In this step, LeadsBridge will ask you to do the mapping between the fields requested by Facebook to recognize the Pixel with your CRM data.

Notice that Facebook doesn’t need to receive your contact's _Email address_, _Phone number,_ and so on, but this kind of mapping between Facebook and the source CRM fields will increase the Matching Rate.

> _Facebook allows advertisers to send multiple pieces of information to recognize their users._
>
> _You can map 1st party data (e.g. email, phone, etc) or additional data (e.g. lead\_id, browser agent data, fbclid, etc) to allow the Facebook platform to properly match your data with the Facebook platform data._
>
> _For sure, the more data you will send to the Facebook platform, the higher will be the matching rate, and the more accurate will be the attribution rate._
>
> _Here you can find a list of full matchable data_ [_https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/server-side-api/parameters_](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/server-side-api/parameters ""https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/server-side-api/parameters"")

Make sure to map every mandatory value marked with a blue star. Usually, **Action Source**, **Event Name,** and **Event Time** are mandatory values, so you should map them accordingly.

You may also want to map fields such as **Event Value** or **Event Currency** if, for instance, you’re syncing your opportunities, which usually have a specific amount.

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/783/296/original.png?f=1688733274&Expires=1748567764&Signature=O4pmaJGHdK~mlkdU6C~~mVSTonw6pLIkhMPwvWNx2bCk4llAhlem2TOFcF-VqCapNikyyhiVBNNJsKuqytaNbS92XCJ648pZVI4N7hgQUNWs1qRq7r3iElcCmkleVJnjbaPSMRnaMFZMOPbooNjol~ci0apDoY5QbmggdL7mQmuI6rAOkKFr1rkXI2hESdg2DmnX~lDyMrxnrEfagVBQ8SE9a6MaTX85-N1JP7la-1ivjhF1GO5MlRHTDPDuDIpY-ezVpHKAc4kSnoaPj5Pq-XYOvUk8gIn~8AByi7q6Pd-8X5iBbZ-XxL8bd5HBxNtKIFjWvQvWlRYLHJy9JJ2o7A__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Once you have mapped all the required and optional fields, you can click on **Continue** to activate your Bridge.

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/783/329/original.png?f=1688734295&Expires=1748567764&Signature=Eutp3Y-xqlWZFTfKOO7xhq8QQqzsqv4KjaYPb2TcZQvhc~-MggQArfEAdFtQhD2P-ORzj7u4TCpTSlwrDJuorv7ORFwoHM~cwYY0EVPUa0Lui3jyfPxlVrSAoj0Jn3bEIIySPWQn3rkNWCKDJ9FC0BcBPNUgpIvqBy66f~jF4Yu-TjruvbesqA3X3~-pNdJMdeTHJzZp176Q8jotjPplqgz7VZcI9m6kRrvdJQV7-8Qju-foEL3G71r4L-UrepXhzN6WGau9h54nt4tYkj2D85FdALE6J1rUJ5QRQRycPlVxdtNCqxjRj5VgbNO2EkDPvUKD8E0x-BJCp6ioVxaatQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

That’s it. When the sync period begins, your Bridge will start the elaboration and validation of your Source data and, if you have set your Bridge on **Live Sync**, LeadsBridge will sync the data to your Facebook Pixel.

So, once the first sync process ends, you’ll be able to see your matched CRM contacts inside your Facebook Events Manager.

# How to enable Facebook Leads Ads and Audiences TOS?

In order to use Facebook Lead Ads and LeadsBridge, you need to accept:

1. The [Facebook Ads TOS](https://www.facebook.com/legal/self_service_ads_terms)
2. The [Lead Ads TOS](https://www.facebook.com/ads/leadgen/tos)

_Note that the TOS must be accepted at the Page level_

Facebook prohibits a specific action once the lead is collected, such as creating a username and password inside the Lead Ads form.

LeadsBridge offers you custom integration and solutions, but **we are not responsible for a potential ban or violation of Facebook Inc. TOS and policies**.

You are responsible for your own action, even if you create a custom integration through LeadsBridge.

LeadsBridge is free to terminate your account if you fail or ignore to comply with the Facebook TOS and policies.

## **Privacy Policy in your Lead Ad**

Facebook, moreover, requires you to have a clear Privacy Policy in your Lead Ads form. Please refer to your Ad account manager to get more information, or [visit this page](http://www.iubenda.com/blog/2015/11/20/privacy-policy-for-facebook-lead-adverts/) to generate a Lead Ads privacy policy (maintained by Iubenda).

If you are unsure about which Privacy policy is provided in your Lead Adverts, please call your Accountant or your Layer for further information.

## **Custom Audiences TOS**

In order to use Facebook Custom Audiences with LeadsBridge, you need to accept the following:

1. [The Facebook Custom Audiences Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/customaudience)
2. [The Facebook Terms For Conversion Tracking, Custom Audiences From Your Website, and Custom Audiences From Your Mobile App](https://www.facebook.com/legal/technology_terms)

Moreover, while syncing your Custom List Custom Audiences with your CRM/ESP, you have to accept our [TOS](https://leadsbridge.com/tos/) and state that the data housed in your own CRM have been legally collected from reliable sources and that **you have permission to use them for marketing purposes**.

Importing data on Facebook without the express permission to use them may violate the law and result in the suspension of your Facebook advertising account and your  LeadsBridge account as well.

## How to accept Facebook Custom Audience TOS?

If you're experiencing an error while setting up Facebook Custom Audiences on your LeadsBridge account, it might be related to the Custom Audience Terms of Service (TOS), which need to be accepted on Facebook.

1. Go to the Facebook Ads Manager and select your Facebook Ad Account. Open the hamburger menu and go to the Audiences section. On the top of the screen, a blue bar will appear, asking you to accept the TOS for the Ad Account.
2. As an alternative, you can also click on the Accept TOS link that shows up in the error message on LeadsBridge **.** This will send you to a new page where you can accept the TOS.


**Please note** that the TOS should be accepted for every Facebook Ads account separately.

#### How\_Does\_TrustedForm\_Work\_2023-07-26.mp4

#### Transcript:

TrustedForm is ActiveProspect's solution for independently documenting and storing lead events, which are the actions that a consumer performs on a web page. TrustedForm stores the record of these events in a certificate. If the lead events show properly obtained user consent, then the TrustedForm certificate can be used as proof of consent. TrustedForm interacts directly with the consumers device, recording what they did and saw as they filled out and submitted a web or mobile app form. It stores information about the user's device and activity during their visit to the page and can generate a visual playback of that consumer's experience on request.

The certificate contains a copy of the web page's source code, associated files like style sheets, JavaScript, images and videos, and metadata, which is information about the consumers device, their browser, the host of the web page, IP address and user performed events like mouse movements and clicks, screen resizes and key presses. From this data, TrustedForm also calculates and stores other useful metadata like typing speed, time on page and more.

The information that TrustedForm collects remains stored only within TrustedForm's data warehouse and can't be modified by any other party.

When a person views a TrustedForm certificate, it's displayed on a TrustedForm-hosted Web page. Let's look at how TrustedForm works.

First, the publisher of the web page includes a small JavaScript snippet on the page.

When the consumer loads the page into their device’s browser,

that script contacts the TrustedForm service directly from the user's device and begins sending TrustedForm the information that will become the certificate.

At the same time, TrustedForm sends a unique ID, the TrustedForm certificate URL, down to the user's browser where it's added to the web form as a new hidden field.

This exchange of information continues until the user submits the form or abandons the web page.

That closes the connection to TrustedForm, which temporarily stores the certificate. When the consumer submits the form, the information they typed into the form’s fields, plus any hidden fields like the TrustedForm cert URL field, is sent to the form’s target, which could be LeadConduit, a CRM, or any other application,

and the connection to the user’s browser closes.

Up to this point in the process, no charges have accrued. There was no cost to the web publisher for including the script on their form page, nor is there a cost for the certificate that was created. The TrustedForm service will retain the certificate for a specified number of days, but its contents can't be accessed for free.

During that period, any TrustedForm customer who has the certificate URL can tell TrustedForm’s “Retain” service to store the certificate in their account for long term protection against future consumer complaints. Per their ActiveProspect contract, they're charged a fee for retention and storage. A typical storage interval is five years to allow for legal statutes of limitations. The retain action was formerly called claiming.

Every entity that handles a lead, be they a web publisher, broker, or advertiser, should protect themselves by retaining their TrustedForm certificates.

Retaining a certificate also enables TrustedForm’s session replay and share URL features. We'll talk about Session Replay in a minute.

If you received a lead with a phone number of 123-456-7890, but the TrustedForm certificate shows that 212-555-1212 was entered as their phone number in the form. Wouldn't you want to know? TrustedForm's lead matching feature formerly known as Fingerprinting is designed to empower you to identify cases like this and ensure your certificates match with the lead. How does lead matching work? As TrustedForm collects user input from the page, e-mail address or phone number form data is securely hashed and stored within the certificate.

When you make a match lead request or Retain a Certificate you can pass your lead's e-mail address and phone number as parameters in that request. TrustedForm compares the values stored within the certificate with the values passed in your request and the response tells you if they match.

Session replay is a re-creation, displayed on a TrustedForm hosted Web page, of the consumer's experience. On the left is a consumer filling out a form. TrustedForm has added the hidden TrustedForm cert URL field to the form, has received the page source code from the user's browser, and is recording the user's mouse actions and key presses as they occur.

On the right you can see the certificate for that page visit. Clicking the ""Session Replay"" button recreates the web page from the source code and other files in the certificate then overlays a recreation of the mouse movements, clicks, key presses, and screen changes the consumer made. It looks like a video of the consumer's screen while they were on the page.

TrustedForm enforces a data security enhancement which limits access to TrustedForm Session Replays to parties who already have access to the submitted consumer data. This ensures that all parties involved in the lead generation process are better protected. Due to this, lead matching must be performed when retaining a certificate. When viewing a certificate's Session Replay, you'll be prompted to enter the consumer's e-mail address or phone number.

By default, only the TrustedForm customer can view their retained certificates. But retention also creates a unique share URL that the customer can give to legal counsel or others in the event of a complaint.

With the share URL, they can view the certificate, including the playback. Often simply showing the playback to a complainant in a compliance lawsuit is enough to make them drop the complaint.

Metadata is information about the consumers device, their browser, the host of the web page, IP address and user performed events like mouse movements, clicks, screen resizes and key presses. From this data, TrustedForm also calculates and stores other useful metadata like typing speed, time on page and more. To evaluate a certificate's metadata, customers can select and retrieve the specific items they wish via TrustedForm's Insights service.

Insights also provides page scan. In this feature, TrustedForm scans the web page for claimant-specified text. This is handy for ensuring that the web publisher has included the advertiser specified opt-in or privacy language on the page. It can be useful for detecting unwanted incentivizing language that the web publisher may have added. Here you see a web form on the left with consent language highlighted and on the right is part of TrustedForm's response indicating that the text it scanned for was found on the page.

TrustedForm provides the highest standard of user-experience documentation, with independent, secure collection and storage of the user experience. Every web page or mobile app that collects contact data should implement the TrustedForm script, and every business that handles that contact data should be claiming TrustedForm certificates.

# How do I build a bridge with Facebook Conversion Leads?

By sharing your CRM with Facebook, your business can focus on higher quality (or conversion) leads. (This type of integration ultimately relies on Conversions API or CAPI).

Here’s how it works: You set up your CRM so it sends customer data back to Facebook. Facebook can then analyze the type of leads that are more likely to convert and show ads that result in these higher-quality leads. This optimization for your Lead Gen campaigns is called “Conversion Leads.”

Conversion Leads events refer to what happens to a lead after it is generated inside your CRM. These are often called funnel stages. For example:

1. Lead Generated
2. Marketing Qualified Lead
3. Sales Opportunity
4. Converted
5. Disqualified

Note that these event names can be customized freely. Their name doesn’t actually matter as long as their meaning is clear.

### **Before you start, check if your business is a good fit...**

Before starting the integration, here’s how to know if your business will be a good fit for the optimization model. (The guidelines below are to ensure good performance with the model but can be flexible.)

- Use Facebook/Instagram native Lead Ads (Instant Forms)
- Ensure the 15-16 digit Meta Lead ID is mapped to your CRM
- Generate at least 250 leads per month
- Can upload data regularly at least once per day
- The lead stage you want to optimize for occurs within 28 days from the moment leads are generated
- The lead stage you want to optimize for has a conversion rate between 1% - 40%

### Step-by-step guide on how to build a bridge with Facebook Conversion Leads

01. Click on the **Create New Bridge** button on the top left corner of your LeadsBridge account.

02. Select your source of choice. The most recommended ones are popular CRMs like Salesforce, Hubspot, or Zoho CRM.

03. As the destination, select Facebook Conversion Leads and hit the Continue button.




    ![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/910/352/original.png?f=1696319019&Expires=1748567763&Signature=JXEYhoMcVSlOhxWSHl4qSpSImSRq~Um9~4rDt-KNvs-8Eo9yCDtV2a5DvZwmQOgBC2ABV46-W~owKsAgwNCahRcZjkDO6gz6bNvnOQFrdBQBDEDoGrFl3os1QGstTf6V~dzbHYJwgtUm3RIQtkFwC4Y6eSldCssaEvV2xfcTEunBxBSPYPz9dE3zOT5txujYuxY77EHrixtocQXifYpKoQVM6gJq~DpFjwy1w4KAsYg66aGXgwVCRBQ8KG3~O1CJfwDh-OSlo74qxQ~W5NbHTMi983RAxAu~jnBmoYlvpQ1Btz1glEdYDLGuKu2jRVf7nysWZsE89TQS45mim6mymQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)
04. The first thing to do is to authenticate the access to your source

    - Click on **Connect** (followed by the name of your source, like Salesforce)

    - Then click on **Create new integration**. As an alternative, you can also select a previously used integration.
05. Follow the steps on the screen to authenticate the access with your source system

06. The configuration steps at this point may change depending on the system you use as the source

    - Generally, you will need to choose which Entity (or record type) we want to retrieve from your source system (e.g., Leads, Opportunities, Contacts, Records, etc. - every integration has different entity options). To do this, select one of the available options from the Manage “Objects”  dropdown

    - Choose your Segment type (e.g., Static or Dynamic List views, Spreadsheets, Files, etc. - every integration has different segmentation options). To do this, select one of the available options from the Use “Segment” as a dropdown

    - Then, depending on the entity and the segmentation chosen, you will need to select your Action. For instance, if you’ve selected Salesforce as your source, Lead as your entity, and List View as your segment, under Action, you will find a list with all the List Views created in your Salesforce instance containing Lead Objects
07. Now it is time to set up the Facebook side. Click on Connect Facebook Conversion Leads and click on Create new Integration

08. Follow the instructions on the screen, and make sure to select the right Business Manager and all the other resources, especially the correct Meta Pixel you want to send events

09. Once this process has been completed successfully, you will need to:

    - Select your Pixel from the **Pixel** dropdown

    - Select your syncing frequency by choosing an option from the **Sync Each** dropdown. We suggest using the default 6 Hours option but feel free to choose a different one depending on your needs

    - Select when you want to start syncing by choosing an option from the **Start Sync** dropdown. We suggest leaving this option as Automatically Detec
      ![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/910/353/original.png?f=1696319086&Expires=1748567763&Signature=ZRlPyuyMkCoTgpK8aUb58~D82-LjIw1UCITQUoz5exlCX87e-w0AUNQnhd0dhCefunJA-hBo62e6ZuGKEa27bGFyNNG396TjriU82ha1Bs34vVO0Unpy0Wyzpbnc6niHNVuHJyfAclctaXF2hTAou7h~Qo3zKJJ91M~18CB2lheNz1lkzpe3CjX4bMns35xDDiqJnnFrrpKHWXuY4CvpLu44Os~HkBlJsyzwwNW~HdXNTgxiMl~XusgJu6AENwXYpaSd2mwUwmuvZNxW2VTsiX8D4HwC9I11b4sJetcqnLQUo4~bdcbYbPc~F-fO7x2D06WlRmpQH8MG2j9uXMphtQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)
10. When you’re ready, hit the **Continue** button.

11. It is now time to set up the Fields Mapping:

    - **Event Name:**

      1. If you are creating only one bridge because you can retrieve this value from one of your source fields, simply select one of the fields from your source and map its value to the Event Name. We will include it in the payload for Meta.

      2. If this value cannot be found within the fields that come from your source, you will need to set a static value here and create multiple bridges with different hardcoded values. To set a static value for one of the mapped fields, in the mapping of the field, click on the empty source field, type the name of the field and select **Create** text option.
    - **Event Time:** Select from the fields of your source the one that represents the event time for this particular event. Note that we need to select a field with the value of a timestamp of type Date/Time.

    - **Lead Id**: This is an essential step. Select from the fields of your source the one that contains the Facebook Lead ID of that specific record.
12. Click on the **Save & Publish** button.


Now you’re all set! You can access the newly created bridge by going to the CRM Integration section under the Facebook Suite: [https://leadsbridge.com/app/facebookConversionLeads](https://leadsbridge.com/app/facebookConversionLeads).

From here, you can see the status of your Conversion Leads bridges. You can hit the **History** button for each of them. This will show you what happened in all the previous uploads.

For each of these uploads, you can even download a CSV file with a detailed list of all the records we tried (successfully or not) to upload to the Meta Pixel.

If you need additional help, check out our Community, or get in touch with our [Support team](mailto:support@activeprospect.com).

## **Common Questions**

### **How can I retrieve the events I need from my CRM for this optimization?**

Situations are all different. It depends on which CRM you’re using and on the particular workflows that your business has in place. Sales are not made in the same way in every business. Don't hesitate to [reach out to us](https://leadsbridge.com/contact-us/) if you need guidance setting up this integration.

### **What is the CRM Integration?**

The Facebook CRM integration is a way to retrieve events from a CRM and send them via CAPI. According to Facebook, CRM Integration can be performed either manually (with internal technical support) or with the help of a partner (such as LeadsBridge).

With the CRM integration, the only valid leads that will be considered for the Conversion Leads optimization are leads that come from Facebook. In other words, leads generated with a Facebook Lead Generation paid campaign, ones that have a Facebook Lead ID. In fact, all leads generated, for instance, on a Web form or that come into the CRM from sources that are not Facebook campaigns, will not be considered for the Conversion Leads optimization.

### How to check that my campaign is using Conversion Leads Optimization?

Once all of this has been done, you should [follow the steps listed at Meta’s Business Help Center](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/279369167153556) and make sure to:

- Configure the Pixel you used in LeadsBridge as a CRM connection and

- Set up the Sales Funnel and choose which Conversion Leads event you want to optimize for.


If you did this correctly, in Meta’s Events Manager, your Pixel will show up with this icon:

By going into Settings, you should see three blue checkmarks proving that the Sales Funnel was set up correctly:

# What is a Bridge?

A **bridge** is a connection between two platforms/applications. Through the bridge, multiple data can be synchronized in real-time. The entire process is automated, and no manual upload is required.

An application can be an advertising platform and its product (for example, Facebook Leads Ads campaign) that is used to send data to another application or your CRM of choice (for example Salesforce or Hubspot).

Using LeadsBridge, it's possible to build a bridge in a few steps: [**Let's get started**](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5062321-step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-create-a-bridge) **!**

For pages that are connected to a Meta Business, you will need to also **be connected to the business and have a role configured**, as well as approve LeadConduit’s access to the Business when the permissions are requested.

When connecting your Facebook account to LeadConduit for the first time, you will be prompted to grant LeadConduit all of these required permissions. The prompts will appear as below:

# Does the TrustedForm Certify Web SDK vary from advertiser to advertiser?

The TrustedForm script is the same for everyone. It is a generic script that generates a certificate that gets passed with the lead. Anyone with a TrustedForm account that receives a certificate can verify its legitimacy using our HTTP API.

# Do I need to generate a different TrustedForm certificate for each lead buyer?

If you sell shared leads, then this can be a concern. The answer is, ""No, there should just be one certificate per lead."" If you are selling the lead 3 times, you’ll pass the same certificate to 3 different buyers.

# How do I know what data is being collected by the TrustedForm Certify Web SDK? Should I be concerned?

ActiveProspect is an independent technology provider that has been in business since 2004. A variety of Fortune 500 corporations trust us to process and store their data.

We designed the system so that we are completely transparent about the data that is being collected. The data collected is available in the Certificate. The certificate is available only to those that handle the lead data.

We’ve gone to great lengths to make sure publishers are comfortable with the service. In fact we completely rebuilt the application in 2011 for this reason. We hide the query string of all page URLs just in case they contain proprietary information such as search keywords. We provide [legal terms to publishers](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform-eula/) outlining exactly what the script does and doesn’t do.

You can test it yourself. After you implement the script on your page, you can capture the Certificates and not forward to your lead buyers. This will give you the opportunity to review what is being collected before making the decision that you want to pass the Certificates to your buyers. Furthermore, anyone can signup for a paid account. You can try it out and see exactly what your lead buyers see.

# How to Retrieve Your Retained TrustedForm Certificates

The TrustedForm Certificate URL is your key to future protection.

To prepare you for making the most of your TrustedForm retained certificates, here are a few tips to follow:

- Be sure that each lead's retained TrustedForm Certificate URL is sent to and stored as a URL in your system of record. The TrustedForm certificate URL must be used to retrieve a certificate in the event of a consumer complaint. A certificate can't be retrieved in any other way. Other data fields such as email, phone, or lead ID are not sufficient to retrieve a certificate.
- TrustedForm certificate URLs may be hundreds of characters in length, so be sure to allocate a large enough string field in your system of record.

# Why can't I just pass the data without using TrustedForm?

TrustedForm is a neutral 3rd party lead certification service. TrustedForm gives lead buyers confidence that the information being passed is correct. So even if you are already passing this information, TrustedForm provides 3rd party verification that it is correct.

These types of services are common across all types of industries. For example, when you buy a diamond it typically comes with a certificate provided by the GIA (Gemological Institute of America) or AGS (American Gem Society). Financial statements are another example. Public companies must have their financial statements audited by 3rd parties, giving investors confidence to actively invest in the stock market. Similarly, TrustedForm will give lead buyers confidence in their leads.

# Does the TrustedForm Certify Web SDK collect information about traffic sources?

No, TrustedForm does not secretly collect information about traffic sources. We are explicit about all the information that is collected by the script.

There is a lot of confusion about the collection of traffic source data because the first version of TrustedForm that was released in June 2010 collected referer URLs. We received a lot of push back from vendors about this. We agreed with the publisher feedback so with the next version of TrustedForm we stopped collecting referer URLs. We also started truncating the site URLs to hide and query string data that might reveal traffic sources to a lead buyer. In addition, we made all of the data collected by the script publicly available on the certificate to anyone that handles the lead data.

# Retaining a TrustedForm Certificate Via the API

ActiveProspect account holders who are subscribed to TrustedForm and have added a payment method who are able to use the TrustedForm Certificate API to retain the certificates provided with certified leads. Doing so

1. Confirms the legitimacy of the certificate
2. Gives your account access to view the certificate
3. Stores the certificate for future reference


See our [full API documentation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Certificate-URL/) for additional detail.

To retain a certificate using the TrustedForm API, send an HTTP POST request to the certificate URL which should be provided with your leads's data. (If not, ask you lead vendors to implement [TrustedForm Certify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/certify))

- Do not make a request unless the URL starts with `https://cert.trustedform.com`, otherwise you may expose your TrustedForm credentials to someone else
- Use a POST request — any other type of request will not retain the certificate
- Use the `Accept: application/json` request header
- Use the `Content-Type: application/json` or `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` header, and encode the request body accordingly.
- In the Authorization header, use [HTTP Basic Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) and pass the API key provided on the ""Settings"" tab in the [TrustedForm Application](https://app.trustedform.com/?__hstc=41051389.72b0a82a2e175bcc391c91a5b5ff308d.1748564170875.1748564170875.1748564170875.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564170875&__hsfp=3707738794#settings) as the password and 'API' as the ID.

# Reference

When you retain a certificate, you can include an optional parameter `reference` We will store this value in the certificate's history record. A use case for the reference parameter is to add your unique lead identifier to the history record, which will provide a reference point from the certificate to the certified lead that you received.

This will indicate which lead a certificate belongs to just by examining the certificate data. If you retain a certificate from a LeadConduit flow, the LeadConduit Lead ID will be automatically assigned as the reference. This allows you to refer back to the lead with which an individual certificate was collected.

# Vendor

When retaining a certificate, you can pass the optional `vendor` parameter. We will store this value  in the certificate's history record. Some TrustedForm reporting will be grouped by vendor.

If you use our LeadConduit platform, the vendor parameter will be automatically set as the Source name with each certificate retain request.

# Response Codes

- If you successfully retain a certificate, an HTTP 200 OK status code will be returned with the JSON representation of the certificate in the response body. Beware that using an HTTP GET will also return an HTTP 200 along with the HTML representation of the certificate — your cert will not be retained with an HTTP GET.
- If the certificate has expired or never existed, then an HTTP 404 Not Found status code will be returned.
- If you have not authenticated correctly using your API key, an HTTP 403 Forbidden status code will be returned.
- If you receive a 5XX Server Error status code, please retry the retain request. If it continues to fail, please contact support@activeprospect.com

If you receive any response code other than those above, please [let us know](mailto:support@activeprospect.com).

# Logging and Support

Customers must maintain their own logs of requests made to the TrustedForm API. ActiveProspect does not maintain logs of API requests, and ActiveProspect Support cannot ""look up"" API requests to provide diagnostic assistance.

If your requests to the TrustedForm API are failing and you can provide us with the raw Http request and the raw Http response returned, ActiveProspect Support may be able to identify the nature of a malformed request. ActiveProspect Support generally cannot instruct you in how to configure your application to make an API request.

# Why aren’t leads synced in real-time from Facebook Lead Ads to my CRM?

If you are experiencing an issue retrieving leads in real-time from Facebook, you may need to make sure you granted to LeadsBridge the Lead Access permission from your [Facebook Business Manager.](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/442345745885606?id=180505742745347)

The Business Manager is a Facebook tool designed to improve assets management: with this tool, you’ll be able to manage your Pages, Ad Accounts, Apps, Partners, etc., giving specific Asset permissions to Users and Partners.

As a result of this management, if permissions are not properly configured, you could encounter one of the following situations:

- You are not able to fetch any lead when opening the Leads Table of your bridge.

- You’re only able to see the test leads sent from your Facebook account.

- You’re able to see the leads, but they are not being automatically synchronized in real-time by LeadsBridge


If one of the above-mentioned situations arises, the following guidelines will help you set the correct permissions inside Business Manager. Be sure to follow the step-by-step instructions carefully.

### **Do you have access to a Business Manager?**

**NO** → You should contact the Owner/Admin of the Business Manager that owns the Page you want to connect with LeadsBridge and ask them to follow the steps below on your behalf.

**YES** → Log into the Business Manager and go to [Business Settings](https://business.facebook.com/settings/).

### **Can you see Integrations » Leads Access on the left side of the screen?**

**NO** → You should contact the Owner/Admin of the Business Manager that owns the Page you want to connect with LeadsBridge and ask them to follow the steps below on your behalf.

**YES** → This means that you are the Owner/Admin of the Business Manager.

### **Once you’re inside the Business Manager and you know you’re the Owner/Admin**

1. Go to **Accounts » Pages**. Do you want to give access to a User or a Partner?

1. **USER**

      1. Go to Users » People

      2. Click on the User name

      3. Make sure that the BM User has a role (ADS, LEADS, CONTENT: Create, Manage or Moderate) inside the Facebook Page
2. **PARTNER**

      1. Go to Users » Partners

      2. Click on the Partner name

      3. Make sure that the Business Manager Partner has a role inside the Facebook Page

1. Go to **Integrations » Leads Access**

1. HELP! I can’t see “Integrations » Leads Access” This means that you’re not a Business Manager Owner/Admin → Go back to the beginning of the guide

2. Click on the Page

3. Do you want to give access to a User or a Partner?

      - **USER** → Make sure the User has been added to the People section, otherwise add it using the Assign People button

      - **PARTNER** → Make sure the User has been added to the Partners section, otherwise, add it using the Assign Partners button.

1. Do you see the **CRMs** tab?

1. **NO** → Contact the Business Manager Owner/Admin that Owns the Page and ask them to follow the steps described in this guide.

2. **YES** → Click on CRMs: Is LeadsBridge listed under the Apps section?

      1. **YES** → GREAT! Everything has been set up correctly!

      2. **NO** → Click on Assign CRMs, is LeadsBridge listed under Add CRMs and Set Permissions?

         1. **NO** → Log into your LeadsBridge application and Publish a bridge connecting the Page you’re working with

         2. **YES** → Select LeadsBridge and click on Assign

# How do I send a test lead from Facebook?

You can follow these steps to send a test lead with real data from Facebook:

1. Click here: [https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing)
2. Choose the Facebook Page where you want to insert the test lead
3. Click on the **Delete lead** button in case you've already submitted a lead from your Facebook account on this form. In fact, leads can only be submitted once to a particular form
4. Click on the **Preview form** (do not click on **Create lead** button, as this will send the test lead with the _[test@fb.com](mailto:test@fb.com)_ email address)
5.  Insert any valid email and data
6.  Click on **Submit**

If you are **an Admin/Owner** of the Page and have all Facebook Business Manager Permissions, including the LeadsBridge app as a CRM, attached to that Page, you will see the following response from Facebook:

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/477/110/original.png?f=1725970698&Expires=1748567773&Signature=cWpigMsz96v3p4Rl9pIv06~9j27XW0TIUryBfnmXhvUgYpYsdQDPg0UkUdUSW9Ekm27wQU2xUcHLQTQCjdyZT04yKO9xdF6Eu016QRP5MA0~7xrzavCiP9JW~npTXaLSCnyojGGBJlFHMaFrUD3HFFhoR7BK0DemLExEVSPZVJbNnoHFbhvSsWrLFMVrvUKTD77ViXTaU3gMqOztISdfZ92r~OmmexwV~ytHnzXKf-alEe~bGb1AdW9ymzZNHYlSgoxhCHs6V9IZP1u94q33bb-VEuF3G2fACKlKKLhsCSdFkuS-CBzYuTakluC94jbe7~ZL27VIboFNr6Lyzu5AbA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Once done, the test leads will appear in LeadsBridge and in your CRM/Autoresponder.

## Important notes:

1. Test leads are counted as organic leads and won’t be associated with an Ad.
2. You are allowed to send one test lead per Form. To test more than once, click on Delete Lead first to remove the previous test. This action will only delete the test lead created from Facebook.
3. The [test@fb.com](mailto:test@fb.com) is a fake lead that won’t be recognized by lots of CRM/Autoresponders. In this case, we suggest sending a test lead using real information.
4. If you get the **_103 error: CRM access has been revoked from Lead Access Manager -_** it means that you need to grant LeadsBridge correct permissions to access your Facebook leads. Please consult our community article on [how to enable the right Facebook permissions](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5070199-why-aren-t-leads-synced-in-real-time-from-facebook-lead-ads-to-my-crm).

# What information does TrustedForm make available to lead buyers?

The TrustedForm Certificate of Authenticity is generated by a script is placed on your web page. The Certificate includes the following pieces of information:

1. the URL of the page where the lead was collected
2. IP address of the user submitting the data
3. Browser and OS used by the consumer
4. Date and timestamp of when the user landed on the URL where the script is implemented
5. A snapshot of the HTML, images, CSS, javascript and other page assets as they appeared to the consumer
6. A session replay of the user's mouse movements and clicks, presented visually as an overlay superimposed on a local re-rendering of the snapshot.

The Certificate of Authenticity itself is stored by TrustedForm's servers and can be viewed at the web location identified by the trustedformcerturl field, which is a hidden field that TrustedForm creates and adds to your web page's forms during the user's visit.

# How to filter incoming leads on LeadsBridge?

On LeadsBridge, it's possible to quickly refine incoming leads directly from your Bridge with the **Filter Incoming Leads** tool.

This tool will allow you to refine the leads that get synced using the information you're receiving from your Source so that you may reach out to those leads that meet specific criteria in a more precise and nurturing way and concentrate your efforts on the leads that have the set of characteristics that work for your objective.

For instance, you may filter your leads by their geographic area so that a single Bridge handles the leads coming from a specific location and let your marketing automation be even smoother, ensuring that only leads indicating a particular area will pass through to your Destination, and any other lead won't be handled further.

This Filter allows you also to filter only specific contacts to be synced in your **Facebook Custom Audiences**, **Google Match Audiences,** or **Linkedin Matched Audiences.**

**Note**: Filters are available starting from the [Starter plans](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5039672-how-do-i-choose-the-right-leadsbridge-plan-for-me). If you’re on a Free plan, you can get a free 14-day trial to test this feature.

## How does it work?

To use the filtering tool, you should follow the steps below:

1\. Open your Bridge

2. Go to the **Fields mapping** step

3\. Click on the **Add** **Filter for Incoming Leads** button at the top left

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/779/311/original.png?f=1688478189&Expires=1748567773&Signature=BQKoo9Gk-eA6nmXzfT8lZtgsyAyiryLuDreqMf6k~AQMniU1wcLFew5r1LWIkzGVBqENGXGAqtEEGSr~TseT5sD5Fap91JNxP8hVHDNTQbWN~WUw8rc2PKCclCtL1j7Z-BN2cI~BVyjvXtIxInjtiF1kYOAxsaac5XrQaHESmNG5pz2xHSmelC-aaAucR88pPZn5Mv0vvJRb5Zh2Wdk-IEK9PA-8c5SGHeIBUusDZM7JT3BRgtZS~GbijcfT8VcRXEhGt5~joM2LtsAB44HNvcNhXXuM3E7IOcmkA~5ZpS2t7jynhFgK5CaVsZ5lDdp2M0pF0vTeJL4E9pJqdA-zVw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

4\. Then, select the source field that needs to be analyzed by the filtering tool. In this case, we have selectedthe _Created Time_ field.

5\. In the second drop-down menu we can choose between different conditions depending on the type of field we have previously selected. Since we have selected a _Date Time_ field, we can set conditions such as: Before, Equals, After, BeforeLastDays, and AfterLastDays.

6\. After that, depending on the condition you have chosen, a final set will be available; in there, we should specify the value that needs to match the settings previously selected.

Following the EXAMPLE below, we will type the number _7_ since we only want to sync leads collected in the last seven days.

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/853/650/original.png?f=1692373228&Expires=1748567773&Signature=nYptbxJgCzsn8CiUcdHS3ZoYyY3skpqFlE5HkCgbz0w5wa8daFVxRSjH99mzt40i0TKbw8OJ9l5qxX2AaZv1I2j2OeFk0bMKyYCvETZzERSCnBngqohMWqbKauWQHRBonqIyf2gv1dofKxWDYL9zmz7Fnbhz-TlxoH8YybFGOAH6l-D7Tn5nRY0h7vagnKejk-rd7m8Ykg-Prr597h5Ww8RblMNyDgafuBsL3vc1Up0tlJEmb-SC-bD0Go8GG9vcBGF0Tuja9DjgEIaCU-z8-y2ZwYfAWtlUrG-iCc5vRQWTCNlsRcKCvDiv~NYU38J4JiLpwj8IXAYh~hLy1zCIQA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

There are different conditions and filtering that we can set in the tool.

7\. Remember to click on **Save Changes** to save the filtering settings. Or, you can click on the **Delete** **all rules** button to delete any filter you have created or click on the plus (+) button to add multiple filtering conditions; notice that the lead will get synced only if all conditions are met.

Once you finalize your Bridge filters, you'll see a filter symbol under the **Icon** column of your Bridge list; this symbol will show only in the bridges that have the **Filter Incoming Leads** function set up.

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/766/857/original.png?f=1687468592&Expires=1748567773&Signature=pB3lJVxK4psf98MUr4Gh04CK92hEXZ5lXWNl-~gFDg2za6jfDL65I~N8~cCuBTBTSq9XyFUEtWYTppr4o-zkK6gZ7XaRrY7MG-l51iV8a3YVJLPst9kmJYvI6Xepa5ItPDOBzfDuJAUIpZPR-DAqwrXhcTUPfd3ZUNeSLM9KPdqvkwRlSUCqHA8uR~vfP0vCE7thvM3Zl1NEiQ22gvgoz6fO221HCDeJCfGCzfp8Vw9a89Z1334Emv3MuNwMpWbwOMBREiJbTnekXufQ8zqPjDVWkX6fDoo0lu7DhyWvAb7hkYBWbhABqK3n5sWqIL2ggMSK9h5QEWoDRbAHsKoKKg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

**NOTE**:  It is also important to keep in mind that the filtering conditions will be applied from the moment you set them. This means that if you apply the filters to an existing Bridge or Audience, the conditions will be applied only starting from the next sync.

# How do I reauthorize my Facebook Ad Account?

If you are connected to your LeadsBridge account via Facebook Ad Account, it could happen that your Facebook Ad Account has expired or some information has been changed on the Facebook side. In those cases, you should reauthorize your account in order to refresh your Facebook account connection with LeadsBridge.

In order to reauthorize your Facebook Ad Account while using different  bridge configurations, you should follow the steps below:

### Complex Bridge

1. Log in to the **Facebook account** you’ve connected with LeadsBridge
2. Then, log in to your **LeadsBridge account**
3. On the left column, go to **Facebook Suite** » **[Ad Accounts](https://leadsbridge.com/app/adAccounts)**
4. **Click** on the **name** of the Facebook account you want to re-authorize (it should be the same one you’ve logged on the first step)
5. **Click** on the **Reauthorize** button, as shown in the screenshot below:


![LeadsBridge reauthorize ad account button](https://d3pef22pb68mhq.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/17150049/5a6802ae366650556020e3b774c37226_Screenshot-2019-05-17T123A553A59.894Z.png)6\. A new Facebook page will open, follow the instructions and give all the required permissions

#### **What does ""Error validating access token: the user has changed the password"" mean?**

The following error shows up when the password for the account has been changed, as it stops LeadsBridge from accessing it. To fix this, you should **Reauthorize** the Ad Account from which you have changed the password.

- **Add-On transactional pricing**: Refers to the method of determining cost based on the variable and fixed transaction costs associated with marketplace integrations.
- **Appended data**: Data, beyond the fields originally submitted and related to the lead, that is added to the lead data package as it is processed in a LeadConduit flow.
- **Bespoke Integration:** A source or recipient integration designed to work with a specific source's submission format or API.

  - The data as submitted by the source.
  - Certain system data such as the identity of the source and the timestamp of the submission.

# How do I choose the right LeadsBridge plan for me?

LeadsBridge offers 4 pricing plans:

- The **Free plan**, is a self-service free forever plan.

- The **Starter plan**, is a basic self-service paid plan.

- The **Pro plan**, is a self-service paid plan.

- The **Business plan**, is a managed paid plan.


## Free plan

Our Free plan allows you to **connect all the top advertising platforms** – including Facebook, Instagram, Google, Youtube, LinkedIn, and TikTok – **and webforms with your favorite marketing tools**, to move leads across platforms in real-time, for free.

This plan **includes 1 running bridge**, it lets you sync up to **2 fields** (like Name and Email, for example),and allows you to **move 50 leads per month**. What does this mean? It means that inside your LeadsBridge platform you can potentially have more than one bridge, but you can only have one bridge up and running at a time.

And if you don’t have a CRM, don’t worry. With this plan, you can **send automated welcome emails to your prospects for free** without needing any sort of CRM system.

The Free plan is a **perfect fit for all marketers who are approaching the advertising world for the first time**. And if they need support, they can rely on our [community articles](https://community.activeprospect.com/).

## Starter Plan

If you need to be able to have more than 1 bridge running at the same time, the Starter plan is your best option, and a great solution if you have a small budget but still need to run multiple automations.

This plan’s starting point includes 3 bridges and 800 leads per month, and it lets you sync up to **6 fields** for $29 a month (billed annually). From there, you can fully customize your plan with as many bridges and as many leads as you need (for a maximum threshold of 2,000 leads/mo and 6 bridges). The monthly fee will be adjusted accordingly.

Starter users have the opportunity to receive a notification via email every time a lead interacts with their ad or web form.

The Email Receipt feature allows all paying LeadsBridge users to keep track and have a better understanding of their lead generation efforts. So, after completing the bridge creation, a little switch button will activate this feature and you will start receiving notification emails about each new lead coming in.

Everything that is included in the Free plan is also included in the Starter plan. Plus, you will have access to [Online-to-Offline Tracking](https://leadsbridge.com/conversions-sync/).

You have 14 days to try it for free - no credit card required \- and see if it works for you. And if you need help, you can rely on our Customer Support Team to assist you by email.

## Pro Plan

**If you’re a seasoned marketer** who needs to transfer loads of lead data by using complex bridges and formulas, **the Pro plan is what best fits your needs**.

It allows you to generate an **interconnected marketing ecosystem**, which will help you build a **stronger omnichannel strategy**.

The Pro plan starting point includes **15** **bridges and 2.000 leads per month,and it lets you sync up to 40 fields for $79 a month**(paid annually). From there, you can fully **customize your plan** with as many bridges and as many leads as you need and the monthly **fee will adjust accordingly**.

**Everything that is included in the Starter plan is also included in the Pro plan**. Plus, you will have **access to all complex** [**automotive CRMs**](https://leadsbridge.com/integrations/categories/automotive-software/ ""https://leadsbridge.com/integrations/categories/automotive-software/"") (such as ADF/XML, VinSolutions, DealerSocket, elead, and more), [**Gym & Fitness apps**](https://leadsbridge.com/integrations/categories/gym-fitness-management/ ""https://leadsbridge.com/integrations/categories/gym-fitness-management/"") (such as Mindbody), webhooks, devs tools, [**Custom Audiences**](https://leadsbridge.com/custom-audiences-sync/ ""https://leadsbridge.com/custom-audiences-sync/""), and [**Online-to-Offline Tracking**](https://leadsbridge.com/conversions-sync/ ""https://leadsbridge.com/conversions-sync/"").

Basically, the Pro plan allows you to **unleash the full potential of LeadsBridge**, empowering you to:

- Move leads across 380+ platforms;

- Target and re-engage your ideal potential customers;

- Track your offline conversions data.


You have **14 days to try it for free - no credit card required** \- and see if it works for you. And if you need help, you can rely on our Customer Support Team to assist you either by [email or screen-sharing call](https://leadsbridge.com/contact-us/ ""https://leadsbridge.com/contact-us/"").

## Business plan

If you can’t find the integration you need inside our integrations list, or you have to integrate with your own CRM, don’t worry. We are ready to develop an integration, specifically for you. With the Business plan, you can **rely on our team of developers to build a** [**custom integration**](https://leadsbridge.com/custom-integration/ ""https://leadsbridge.com/custom-integration/"") **that fits your business needs** and handle everything for you. This way, you won’t have to hire developers or devote your own developers’ time to building and monitoring the integration.

You can even add SALM single sign-on (SSO) to ensure secure access to your LeadsBridge account.

With the Business plan, you will have a **dedicated LeadsBridge Customer Success Manager**, who will support you and guide you in setting up and managing your account, allowing you to have **immediate contact with a Partner Solution Engineer**. We offer VIP and SLA support, and if your company requires a **vendor security assessment**, we can make that happen for you with a Business plan.

## How to define how many bridges you need while selecting/upgrading your plan?

Each one of our plans allows you to **create unlimited bridges**. The threshold indicated in each plan only defines **how many bridges can be live and running data at the same time**. Moreover, how many bridges you need is defined by your use case. For example:

- Lead Ads/web form to CRM: Each form is a bridge.

- Webinar (as source or destination): Each webinar is a bridge.

- Google Sheets (as source or destination): Each Google Sheet is a bridge.

- CRM/Email System (as source or destination): Each segment, entity, and list is a bridge.

- Mindbody: Each Site ID/location ID is a bridge.

- Calendar (e.g. Calendly): Each calendar is a bridge.

- Custom Audiences: Each Custom Audience is a bridge.

- Offline Conversion API: Each event is a bridge.

- Chatbot: Each chatbot is a bridge.


Let’s get into more detail with some **additional examples**.

### Example \#1

You use Salesforce as a CRM system and you generate leads from 3 different channels: you have 2 forms on Facebook Lead Ads, 2 forms on LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms, and 1 form on your website. In total, you have 5 forms, therefore you need 5 bridges.

### Example \#2

Your CRM system is HubSpot and you use Zoom Webinar. You have 3 different webinars scheduled on Zoom and you would like to connect each webinar to HubSpot. Each webinar needs its own bridge, so you need 3 bridges in total.

### Example \#3

You use Mindbody, you have 2 Site/Location IDs, and you have 6 forms on Facebook Lead Ads. You would like to split your forms into 2 groups and connect 3 forms to each one of your Mindbody Site/Location IDs. So, 3 forms to 1 Site/Location ID and 3 other forms to the second Site/Location ID. Considering that each form is a bridge, you need 6 bridges in total.

### Example \#4

You have a Salesforce list with 3000 contacts and would like to send these contacts to different Custom Audiences as follows: 500 contacts to one Custom Audience on Facebook, 500 contacts to another Custom Audience on Facebook, 1000 contacts to a Custom Audience on Google, 1000 contacts to a Custom Audience on LinkedIn. In this case, you need 4 bridges total, one for each Custom Audience (2 for Facebook, 1 for Google, and 1 for LinkedIn). This logic applies also to the CAPI use case.

If this is for an external lead vendor, you can safely share this Submission Docs URL with your lead vendor. No LeadConduit account credentials are required.

On the Submission Docs page, there are in-depth instructions on how to submit lead data to LeadConduit, including any requirements you configured in the Acceptance Criteria section of the flow, a sample lead request and response in various supported formats.

You can also Batch Import Leads (in CSV format) directly to LeadConduit from the Submission Docs page by clicking the ""Import Leads"" button at the top right of the page.

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/863/102/original.png?f=1631214617&Expires=1748567773&Signature=D0~hibaqRVZ2Deku9g0wIr39OOiSzm0CRm81AtDlDOiUnZl6dHf4BNbN9dgkVAtRIIjG1IGZu~LtIi62NBcAfPNzH~EnSRuCf1QUfozZCp3VNs1FuNw9knayh9tu-qW7mI90UiyIQxPH6Kv7lWi4sMzijOPCF-8JmsMtFskomAwpd8p8V4OjjjvHT~dzw1rOKgxpSL1Jfz~Kc0gvTzkDUQ3zXj4blg4VAlu0v79XrXvvnD5YDnmjKKOiBW7B30EfXnmPQm7k4Z3hI0RIvXt0MiEowfTPQregCM71TxIgau9RVPLj6c1tivX-5mqSj4ruaVLQ11oeBQadVzjjwp32ZA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

The batch import process takes place in your browser. The browser processes the CSV and dispatches each lead request individually. Most browsers have a maximum of 6 concurrent http requests so, at most, 6 leads are being processed simultaneously. From there it depends on the overhead inherent in http itself plus whatever the actual processing time is for each lead.

# Retaining TrustedForm Certificates in LeadConduit

ActiveProspect account holders with TrustedForm and LeadConduit subscriptions can easily retain TrustedForm certificates by adding a TrustedForm Add-on step to their flow.

If the TrustedForm step is successful (or even if it's a failure based on Page Scan requirements), we'll store your certificate for the amount of time you've specified in your account (5 years is the default). If the TrustedForm step produces an error, the certificate may have passed the retention period, the certificate URL may be invalid or missing, or the retain process may have encountered an error.

# Before We Begin

This article assumes you're able to post the TrustedForm certificate URL to your LeadConduit flow correctly. If you need a refresher, please see the Submission Docs located on the Source tab.

# Steps

**Step 1**: On the ""Flow Steps"" page in the flow editor, go to **Add Step** and select **Add-on**.

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/763/247/original.png?f=1687312482&Expires=1748567773&Signature=kgNdhnDAqi~g0I2k5bbBcYedn79vsfFI-YkqVIF5MF3TneMGnpaF50dPWzCjS9CUo2xd92AHGrluk2eKCgWOXkfjyOVhAYpu2KwUBWhx8ZEu2QFGaocoP~RnndXd1nnFtK4JmqO7db8b9o1c1Fe6-L7kp-lnuCT~xXcVgB~L62OwZ50TScVIZx9ZCI-BXyuVc0yyYe8nov2O5oQjxhjJvjrB0~aEwVEpbla8uKYn9xX7EPUOuDSV0jH6hYw~p8Bro1MAsgyyeo2L5r72qCb7eWQZDN9nRvIkYSD~4KGhhKLBa3ACMC8WViJmESqOxasWWeOsZyWviM4FtClEqoZ4~Q__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

**Step 2**: Select the TrustedForm Add-on by clicking the **Add To Flow** button.

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/763/253/original.png?f=1687312799&Expires=1748567773&Signature=Tp7oPGFnlKSTjsSdgoSRazYzXAabkHAHqPMGR8ilK9XMdtkMAb7JLwEqfI~QTSx6nthn3LVrvU3PhSQ5hgEE9pVCfJ~R1fN6LC-UUcqYjApY04ZpEmKvX9EeXUY-GGm0K4LzQe6CA-P97d8zWmDNHkvgsdEE2IkVt4Ea9ZqonYIMSJvC3Yx0utBcFa9zCSODWmOT7RJbMwf30fUi9ytcNNaj3vAyr-~lduEso4f8N~NmU~KbEhHMJSaIsgNhZBlGrjMHtU9GTaW0~JpyYkI5xyKt~ElgajKPKUYdHIcn1-AYK1nbROHch7AzUqctPALph35pJk63AQGTWtF2iUskBQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

**Step 3:** Select Retain and click Finish.

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/763/255/original.png?f=1687313073&Expires=1748567773&Signature=EytXzxV~iZmUGMsc-hlLNVCLUB6YPGRweMDAljpPyRexLubFZotuDQj5PORdJMgB9o4MYi44z01tpPvJ7lZ0-8B7IKzrqQm3Mgq2AmL~jejMZ3Q05L7qqE2BfE4njg9NrpopcEdERXuywqU0bcgS8cxJB9yBGV7OsPE8sP4RkAxt-URpzLkHQ2Z8FEWmOKO~tXDuWdQyI7Ndbc-CWD4Tcde9f~mSB8InXeIC8zXznZZbUZ-nKQxesi1ON9CbxctI0WHZQTnEp5x~qd7rfEpLKnblAa~wenOSuOC14n0ssTh~SZMd4SZlc-QUdyirQGqYxKDs415F8nUDPubRl7yfSA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

**Step 4**: Decide where the TrustedForm step should occur in your flow and move the step to that location. Typically you'd want to retain/claim the certificate on leads that have passed other validations, such as duplicate-checking and phone validation.

To simply retain a certificate for your account, the step is ready to go. No mappings are necessary. The TrustedForm step will automatically look for and use the TrustedForm Cert Url field to retain/claim the certificate.

**NOTE:** The configuration of an Optional Filter step depends on how you choose to use TrustedForm.

# Filtering Examples

When the TrustedForm outcome is not a success (errors, skips, failures), you could to add a filter after the TrustedForm step to stop the flow and return a **Failure** response for the lead. Otherwise, LeadConduit will respond with a **Success** outcome, even though the TrustedForm certificate was not retained.

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/763/256/original.png?f=1687313614&Expires=1748567773&Signature=cPPQGRwITETPv60cDxyB3zkyoY6Xrueg6wXloLARusBzEjDivxYBBPnoPaKU7pb5DU5RjKDANW8Ev7R0gNcOWVtzHL01oYSCXH3qBd11YflLZxV-kRAtMNrp-FEJOIR~QWB-y9i~WIhZHspUkA6Tm2zkTVQktjXam6Myo5oqDuSBYKVKLrPBcAmCnp9kiZqg3aOSlRSEFxOpVfZVwMYYhlBUMFoBa4yFUXdigDByVi2Em8dMXh6Ovpp62ZRA40xt2js3-noME1G8QqqgsnAyvebkGNJl7UjEe1IuItbS51lyIpyHrTov0sFldBHJwKl60expl4Niv-6h3DIkkm4cLw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Another popular filtering example is:

- Fail a lead only when the TrustedForm step returns a **Error**, allowing TrustedForm Failures (and Skips) to pass through the flow.

# Verify Domain Ownership

Verify your domains in your ActiveProspect Account to start gaining domain specific insights.

### Why Verify?

As a site-owner generating TrustedForm certificates, we want to provide you insights into domain specific certificate volume and give you credit for TrustedForm certificates claimed from your domains. To do that, all you have to do is verify you are the domain owner.

Verifying ownership of domains and sub-domains where you have implemented the TrustedForm Script, lets us positively verify that you created a lead associated with the TrustedForm Certificate.

Once your domain is added, no other account can claim ownership of that domain.

### Verification Process

The process of verifying your domains is simple; we generate a unique code per domain that you add to your domain's dns record and we check for a match in the background.

### 1\. Add your domains to ActiveProspect Account

1. Navigate to the Domain section in [My Account](https://account.activeprospect.com/domains) (if you do not see a Domains, please talk to your admin, this is a permission setting)
2. Select Add Domains
3. List all domains you want to verify
1. If you are verifying subdomains, you can individually add and verify subdomains. Or you can just add the root domain and you'll have an option in step 2 to verify all subdomains.

### 2\. Get your verification code from ActiveProspect Account

1. Under Actions, select the Verify Ownership link for the domain you are ready to verify
2. Copy the unique code

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/944/170/original.png?f=1745956313&Expires=1748567773&Signature=azKb8lxzOYkes20OkFf3HrV5aRkyQkL9lAYbEXvU3b9A-yvRhShRmBoiHXJ~sDuU7MtyOM~R-nFeTcfnLJpCkm1Dtz9tvQaymLaETpiK2wzu-xpnurqOJZnoyV2pP5e0lZGtVIB82e9rm5MxdMF-c~~IGS639lj3Bn29eO775RVu269VbmfYbNK4z3HzuqGxHXS6qdtA~ttbhL8~1ISudakDXLJsKvDj2FHu0RKt1Wl8MOxSao3ggdUGDWEdG8LLXJLnpRkItGayah0LwrvDii51mVbAVFPD7uvxXyQ4ZLVV4LrejzD3oykK5CCUzpBtjJX1p54YEGdfHgWSxO2ivw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

### 3\. Add a TXT record in your domain's DNS registrar

1. In a second browser window or tab, sign in to your domain's DNS registrar/host
2. Go to your domain’s DNS records. The page might be called something like DNS Management, Name Server Management, Control Panel, or Advanced Settings.
3. Select the option to add a new TXT record
1. If you're verifying an individual subdomain, you'll want to add the TXT record to the root domain in your DNS. If you're verifying multiple subdomains for one root domain, your root domain should have multiple TXT records.
4. In the TXT record, set the unique code as the value/answer/destination (the field names vary based on your registrar).

### 4\. (Optional) Verify all subdomains - NEW

If you're verifying a root domain, you'll see an option to also verify all subdomains (STEP 3). If this is selected and auto-retain is enabled for the root domain, auto-retain will also be enabled for **all** subdomains.

_**This will also be reflected under the 'Auto Retain Confirmed Domains' section in [TrustedForm Certify tab](https://app.trustedform.com/certificates/issue?__hstc=41051389.35fac6c93cef7b38a5359d0547f3275d.1748564175270.1748564175270.1748564175270.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564175270&__hsfp=3707738794), as follows:**_

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/944/754/original.png?f=1745989144&Expires=1748567773&Signature=nGUEWtGGnboQKlYnV2LeEpwXM9Af8T4p~obXoiQWLg~8hqiVmkAJD1qm0ifUIyDYuAYwJDtsO~lr20lAPOQyTrbCyuKG4ZdWTC4n3cWZjGwzF3ZXP6VDU-qB-yiUkDAm9gOr9KIB4XeA4rR6Veux5bBUzpjJX1N1OFGNIL~ThMKpEv5id1ERvMvbbwTg6fHlHGquFQTD5m-L0ZwRWCJ7P3caLc8MuO3H0BgO27icAxtHZCd2D5kvPd5FKYnSEOvQAU66jUEmFwbaH7q7fedhHXsB6ZnVJdlUzDSA8itoFxcBt3IpvsE-ZOJs-ezIpSg4lkVjAaFiNgG0oqKvtvwo5Q__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

**_Subdomain Ownership Statuses Explained:_**

- **Confirmed:** This status appears when the option to also verify all subdomains is checked for the given domain. Ownership of subdomains is confirmed.
- **Unconfirmed:** This status appears when ownership of subdomains has not been confirmed (the option to also verify all subdomains is not checked).
- **N/A:** This status appears when the domain itself is a subdomain. Subdomain ownership confirmation is not applicable here because the option to verify subdomains only applies to root domains.

### 5\. Tell ActiveProspect Account to check your verification code

1\. Navigate back to your ActiveProspect Account tab, and select Begin Verification. Once selected, we will star the process of verifying your domain.

2\. Refresh the page to check for updated ownership status

### Do you have a CNAME record on the domain you want to verify?

CNAME records are common for subdomains and TXT records can't be added to domains with CNAME records. If you're verifying a subdomain, add the TXT record to the root domain. If you're verifying multiple subdomains, your root domain can have multiple TXT records (one for each subdomain).

### Domain Statuses

Once you have initiated the verification process, we will continuously check and update the domain status until you remove the domain.

Ownership Status:  represents the current status of the domain. Refresh the page to see the most up-to-date ownership statuses.

Last Checked: timestamp of the last time we checked the verification status of the domain (every time we attempt a verification)

Last Verified:  timestamp of the last successful verification of the domain

### Ownership Status Reasons Explained

- **Verified**: You have proved ownership of the domain! We successfully matched the unique code with your domain's dns record
- **Unverified**: We have not proved ownership of the domain.
  - Ownership not yet verified: you have not started the verification process for this domain
  - Verification pending: you have initiated the verification process but we have not yet verified ownership
  - Code Not Found: you have begun the verification process but no code is found on the dns record.
  - Connection error: there has been a timeout. If an already verified domain receives a connection error, then we will retry verification 10 times using exponential backoff. After 10 connection errors, the domain will be marked as unverified.
  - Domain not found: Domain doesn't exist
  - Code not found: We successfully checked the domain, but there was not a TXT record with the correct code

### Troubleshooting Tips:

- We run a domain verification check in the background at different cadences once you have started the verification process for a specific domain
  - We check **unverified** domains every 5 minutes.
  - We check **verified** domains once a day at midnight (Central Standard Time)
- If the ""Last Checked"" and ""Last Verified"" timestamps are different, the verification has failed.  Meaning, we did not receive a successful verification when last checked.
- A domain is marked unverified if it hasn't been verified in three days.
  - The ownership status will stay verified for a 3 day grace period, if after 3 days of attempts to reverify the ownership status successfully, the verified status will change to unverified with a reason. This grace period is to provide time for you to make planned updates to your domain records and not have your ownership status impacted.
- The Ownership Status - \[reason\] will provide information for you to investigate possible causes of the change in verification status.
- Domains rarely become unverified, common reasons that ownership status changes from verified to unverified;
  - the code is deleted from the TXT record answer
  - loss of ownership of the domain
- If you delete the code in the TXT record answer, all you need to do is re-add the same code back in. No need to generate a new domain code in your ActiveProspect Account.
- Make sure to verify your sub-domains if you wish to auto claim from those domains.
- Only users with the permission, ""Manage user and domains for this account"" will be able to see and manage domains. If you need permissions, please contact your account admin or [support@activeprospect.com](mailto:support@activeprospect.com)





**FAQ**
1. **Can I use the \`verify all subdomains\` checkbox if I’ve already verified some subdomains individually?**
     - Yes. If you have already verified subdomains and then use the \`verify all subdomains\` checkbox on your root domain, it will be duplicative, but that's alright. You can choose to delete the individual subdomains and the related TXT records from your DNS, but it’s not required.
2. **Does the TXT record now only need to exist on the root domain?**
     - The TXT record used to confirm ownership, whether for the root domain or a subdomain, should be placed on the root domain in your DNS. But now, with the \`verify all subdomains\` checkbox, you only need to add your root domain, grab the single TXT record, and add it to the root domain’s DNS entry. This avoids having multiple TXT records on the root domain for different subdomains.
3. **Will the \`verify all subdomains\` checkbox include verification of sub-domains of a sub-domain?**
     - Yes, it should confirm ownership of all subdomains under the root domain. For example, if the root domain is example.com, then both blog.example.com and shop.blog.example.com would be covered.
4. If I’ve already verified my root domain, do I just need to check the box to \`verify all subdomains\`, or is there more to it?
     - That’s correct, you just need to enable the \`verify all subdomains\` checkbox and save. No additional steps are required.

# Step by step, add a new vendor or lead source to your flow

How to add a source for a new lead supplier (e.g., a vendor, partner, or site) to an existing LeadConduit Flow

Periodically, you'll want to set up a new Source in your LeadConduit flow for a new partner, vendor, or web site to send in leads. Here are the steps in that process.

# Gather information

To set up a new source, you'll need to gather the following information:

1.  The name of the vendor, partner, web site or campaign you need to set up. Here we'll call this a ""Vendor"" or ""Source"" but it may be a partner, web site, campaign, or lead supplier.
2. Requirements you have for the data in the leads

# Examine existing sources

If other sources pre-exist in the flow,  assess how existing vendors appear on the Sources tab. You'll want to set up the sources (vendors) consistently in your flow in order to get the most out of your data. Specifically, if you have other sources already:

1. Click the Sources tab. Are there any acceptance criteria that are present and/or customized for each source?
2. Are there mappings that are present for most of the sources, and may need to be duplicated/customized in the new source?
3. Are there mappings that are specific to this particular source that need to be identified out of LeadConduit, such as a value used for particular campaigns or lead sources in your CRM?
4. Does the pricing column for other sources read ""Buyer Price""?

# Adding a Vendor - Details

Now set up the source for the new vendor:

## A. Edit the flow and add the new lead source

1. Click on the flow from the LeadConduit Home or Flows list and pick “Edit Flow.”
2. Click the Sources tab and click “Add Source” at top right
3. Search on the vendor name
4.  If there is a source name already available for this vendor, it will pop up and it's best to click it. Otherwise, enter a vendor name under ""create a new custom source""
5. Pick “LeadConduit Standard” if you are creating a new custom source, in the vast majority of cases
6. Select “Other” as the source classification so that if you want to, you can create a test lead in LeadConduit
7. Click ""Finish""

## B. Set up the acceptance criteria and mappings, if applicable

Set up any acceptance criteria and mappings that mights be needed/requested;  examine whether  other vendors have mappings if you're unsure

## C. Set up the pricing parameters

1. You may need to check whether the pricing of other sources shows ""buyer price"" or the customer has specified pricing that you need to track
2. If the vendor will send in the price of the lead in the ""price"" field, you need to enable ""Buyer Price"" for your new source, click the pricing link to the right of the source in the sources tab;  pick “Vendor.” Click “Save Pricing""
3. If the price is static, you can edit the pricing link, which is initially “$0.00”, and click ""Save Pricing""

## D. Check for (Rare) Source Specific Rules in Your Flow

(Rarely) If your flow is complex in logic, you may benefit from clicking on ""Steps"" and checking for delivery step criteria or filters that reference particular sources - a quick check may identify a rule where you need to include your new Source

## E. Save your changes

Save the flow at top right. Don't forget to save your changes; probably the most common error is forgetting to save your work!

## F. Send submission document

1. Send the new submission document URL out to the team, asking the new vendor to send in a test lead.
2. Click the flow name in the path at top left, in the navigation
3. Click the source name from the drop down list at top right to find the submission doc for the new source.
4. Copy the URL of the Submission Doc from your browser. Here's an example: https://app.leadconduit.com/flows/5e6faa784b842808342a4d25/sources/640a98819d091a08e2/docs
5. Then, send a note back similar to this one to the new lead vendor and the team:



Dear \[Lead Vendor\],

We’ve completed the integration needed for you to submit leads to our lead process. To ensure a smooth and successful collaboration, we would like to provide you with the necessary guidelines for submitting leads to our system via LeadConduit. You should submit the leads to the webhook provided in the Submission Docs, which can be found at: \[insert the submission docs url such as [https://app.leadconduit.com/flows/5e6faa784b842808342a4d25/sources/640a98819d099c468e2/docs\]](https://app.leadconduit.com/flows/5e6faa784b842808342a4d25/sources/640a98819d099c468e2/docs%5D)



Please ensure that all data is formatted correctly and that the required fields described in your Submission Docs are included. Examples are in the Submission Docs; just pick the format from the drop-down and you can see formats and fields included for different submission formats.



Please send over a test lead when you are ready; if you have any questions or concerns regarding lead submission or lead requirements, please do not hesitate to contact us.

# Field any questions that arise during testing

Check LeadConduit each day to see if there are test leads; if a test comes in for the new source and encounters an error, report back the error to the vendor, and request a retry correcting the leads until things are working correctly. Generally, when a lead is successful and you can see it in your CRM or other systems correctly delivered from LeadConduit, you can call the process complete.

# How do I reauthorize my Facebook Ad Account?

If you are connected to your LeadsBridge account via Facebook Ad Account, it could happen that your Facebook Ad Account has expired or some information has been changed on the Facebook side. In those cases, you should reauthorize your account in order to refresh your Facebook account connection with LeadsBridge.

In order to reauthorize your Facebook Ad Account while using different  bridge configurations, you should follow the steps below:

### Complex Bridge

1. Log in to the **Facebook account** you’ve connected with LeadsBridge
2. Then, log in to your **LeadsBridge account**
3. On the left column, go to **Facebook Suite** » **[Ad Accounts](https://leadsbridge.com/app/adAccounts)**
4. **Click** on the **name** of the Facebook account you want to re-authorize (it should be the same one you’ve logged on the first step)
5. **Click** on the **Reauthorize** button, as shown in the screenshot below:


![LeadsBridge reauthorize ad account button](https://d3pef22pb68mhq.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/17150049/5a6802ae366650556020e3b774c37226_Screenshot-2019-05-17T123A553A59.894Z.png)6\. A new Facebook page will open, follow the instructions and give all the required permissions

7\. Once done, you’ll be redirected back to LeadsBridge.

### Simple Bridge

1. Log in to the **Facebook account** you’ve connected with LeadsBridge
2. Then, log in to your **LeadsBridge account**
3. On the left column, go to **Facebook Suite** » [**Accounts**](https://leadsbridge.com/app/facebookAdAccounts)
4. **Click** on the **name** of the Facebook account you want to re-authorize (it should be the same one you’ve created the connection from the first time in the first step of the bridge)
5. **Click** on the **Reauthorize** button, as shown in the screenshot below:

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/828/928/original.png?f=1740660542&Expires=1748567774&Signature=uX~-u50GEgYaQfE8CDwaRJeyheWjn2dV54slfy7afg1XQs6~8h~JUVL0Bi3vs9vbu03gTf~zXdcoqZVrJpm2tmZvMwsr5EzRfR6o4j9e54T1W5KKS4nAm10aUGmo0TuQHTo2Y81DOZIDzlhwkpJKn8Luuny4rGVzZmGyNWcWoCJCyllZvn3sjgDO14Sadw820MsJht7mpWYQHYWIqdwbxfTHjxbaAw0cfMjRobjf2L-yH9scXM8apsaqsby0nY2P3ZCc081-BYcwuINJ13VBucA4IgnaLxbOpAo5sHQp7Xaz6qrI1koNnQOw02hvedhhxaiws~HUsO1TwbrO2DIS8Q__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

6\. A new Facebook page will open, follow the instructions and give all the required permissions

7\. Once done, you’ll be redirected back to LeadsBridge.

#### **What does ""Error validating access token: the user has changed the password"" mean?**

The following error shows up when the password for the account has been changed, as it stops LeadsBridge from accessing it. To fix this, you should **Reauthorize** the Ad Account from which you have changed the password.

# LeadConduit Pro Tip: Use a Template to Save Time Configuring Recipient Mappings.

Save time by using a template to configure recipient mappings. Instead of creating mappings one at a time, create a template, selecting the right-hand value type (for example “Json Property” or “Form Field”) just once, then replicate the empty mapping as many times as needed by clicking the “copy this mapping” icon.

# TrustedForm API Overview

```
The TrustedForm Certificate API is available to TrustedForm account holders based on the products they have purchased and been given access to. Generating certificates DOES NOT require use of the Certificate API. Instead publishers who desire to create certified leads must use one of the SDKs available as part of the TrustedForm Certify product.

Every account with access to TrustedForm products is assigned to one of three TrustedForm API versions (two of them are being deprecated). You can find your TrustedForm API version at by viewing your settings page.

TrustedForm Certificate API documentation can be found at the following links:
4.0
3.0 - deprecated
2.0 - deprecated

# LeadConduit Pro Tip: Optimize the Sequence Order of Alternative Prices, Volume Caps, and Mappings

Sequence order matters when you're creating rules that choose between between multiple prices, volume caps, or mappings. You'll save setup time and your flow will be easier to understand if you put the options with the least-restrictive rules at the top and work down to those with the most restrictive rules at the bottom.

Here’s an example using Source price. We put the default price, with no rules, at the top. Next is a price rule that applies to leads from certain states, and below that is the price for leads received over the weekend.

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/050/679/original.png?f=1642617235&Expires=1748567774&Signature=WR-qTnd93-JuaCCKy-~AxsJ9QHliNrExw~7~g5vAW0HJNZ26-9gM12inWUcrsMynJ4XxIGhIYW6wIltELZdMTw8~GuDFsA1ZEW6wsO4omnVfGDFoDEZHhgC5j-tiFJTW3cxicmGasv2bd-w2H0548mc2xD8Smjxw03hiWI6iC2-RZHfbaPn2aKjhb-ZuxQSZL6pFchBctjXpwfUjRYkTxIq7Qpd3XdmB1Hi1Igqti39dRZHF~obl9TViMQ1aJEY4Vz4QXhzQAh1HAhx7zZZ6LRXZ-Ukx80N0RvPgHbgFJ34mRjFAIl-R3B1Q3YIgyFZdwZXX2YRzFPM66es~EJieMQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Here’s how it might look if we hadn’t paid attention to the sequence. Note that this requires more rules, which wastes time and is confusing to read.

# LeadsBridge Glossary

Get familiar with LeadsBridge's most used terms!

### App

A platform that is available to be connected in LeadsBridge. An app can be implemented or not (on the waiting list).

### Bridge

A Bridge is a connection between two platforms/applications. The connection foresees two entities. Hence it's not possible to have a bridge between multiple sources and destinations.

### Integration

Is the “instance” of an app w/ all the credentials defined (e.g., SFDC with the user already authenticated using the Oauth).

There could be multiple integrations for the same app.

The UI will call integration as “account”.

### Source

It is the integration that sends data to the destination (e.g: Facebook Lead Ads). Leadsbridge retrieves data from the source.

### Destination

It is the integration where data are passed to. It receives the data form the Source (e.g: Google Sheets). LeadsBridge ingest/push data to the destination.

#### How\_Does\_TrustedForm\_Work\_2023-07-26.mp4

#### Transcript:

TrustedForm is ActiveProspect's solution for independently documenting and storing lead events, which are the actions that a consumer performs on a web page. TrustedForm stores the record of these events in a certificate. If the lead events show properly obtained user consent, then the TrustedForm certificate can be used as proof of consent. TrustedForm interacts directly with the consumers device, recording what they did and saw as they filled out and submitted a web or mobile app form. It stores information about the user's device and activity during their visit to the page and can generate a visual playback of that consumer's experience on request.

The certificate contains a copy of the web page's source code, associated files like style sheets, JavaScript, images and videos, and metadata, which is information about the consumers device, their browser, the host of the web page, IP address and user performed events like mouse movements and clicks, screen resizes and key presses. From this data, TrustedForm also calculates and stores other useful metadata like typing speed, time on page and more.

The information that TrustedForm collects remains stored only within TrustedForm's data warehouse and can't be modified by any other party.

When a person views a TrustedForm certificate, it's displayed on a TrustedForm-hosted Web page. Let's look at how TrustedForm works.

First, the publisher of the web page includes a small JavaScript snippet on the page.

When the consumer loads the page into their device’s browser,

that script contacts the TrustedForm service directly from the user's device and begins sending TrustedForm the information that will become the certificate.

At the same time, TrustedForm sends a unique ID, the TrustedForm certificate URL, down to the user's browser where it's added to the web form as a new hidden field.

This exchange of information continues until the user submits the form or abandons the web page.

That closes the connection to TrustedForm, which temporarily stores the certificate. When the consumer submits the form, the information they typed into the form’s fields, plus any hidden fields like the TrustedForm cert URL field, is sent to the form’s target, which could be LeadConduit, a CRM, or any other application,

and the connection to the user’s browser closes.

Up to this point in the process, no charges have accrued. There was no cost to the web publisher for including the script on their form page, nor is there a cost for the certificate that was created. The TrustedForm service will retain the certificate for a specified number of days, but its contents can't be accessed for free.

During that period, any TrustedForm customer who has the certificate URL can tell TrustedForm’s “Retain” service to store the certificate in their account for long term protection against future consumer complaints. Per their ActiveProspect contract, they're charged a fee for retention and storage. A typical storage interval is five years to allow for legal statutes of limitations. The retain action was formerly called claiming.

Every entity that handles a lead, be they a web publisher, broker, or advertiser, should protect themselves by retaining their TrustedForm certificates.

Retaining a certificate also enables TrustedForm’s session replay and share URL features. We'll talk about Session Replay in a minute.

If you received a lead with a phone number of 123-456-7890, but the TrustedForm certificate shows that 212-555-1212 was entered as their phone number in the form. Wouldn't you want to know? TrustedForm's lead matching feature formerly known as Fingerprinting is designed to empower you to identify cases like this and ensure your certificates match with the lead. How does lead matching work? As TrustedForm collects user input from the page, e-mail address or phone number form data is securely hashed and stored within the certificate.

When you make a match lead request or Retain a Certificate you can pass your lead's e-mail address and phone number as parameters in that request. TrustedForm compares the values stored within the certificate with the values passed in your request and the response tells you if they match.

Session replay is a re-creation, displayed on a TrustedForm hosted Web page, of the consumer's experience. On the left is a consumer filling out a form. TrustedForm has added the hidden TrustedForm cert URL field to the form, has received the page source code from the user's browser, and is recording the user's mouse actions and key presses as they occur.

On the right you can see the certificate for that page visit. Clicking the ""Session Replay"" button recreates the web page from the source code and other files in the certificate then overlays a recreation of the mouse movements, clicks, key presses, and screen changes the consumer made. It looks like a video of the consumer's screen while they were on the page.

TrustedForm enforces a data security enhancement which limits access to TrustedForm Session Replays to parties who already have access to the submitted consumer data. This ensures that all parties involved in the lead generation process are better protected. Due to this, lead matching must be performed when retaining a certificate. When viewing a certificate's Session Replay, you'll be prompted to enter the consumer's e-mail address or phone number.

By default, only the TrustedForm customer can view their retained certificates. But retention also creates a unique share URL that the customer can give to legal counsel or others in the event of a complaint.

With the share URL, they can view the certificate, including the playback. Often simply showing the playback to a complainant in a compliance lawsuit is enough to make them drop the complaint.

Metadata is information about the consumers device, their browser, the host of the web page, IP address and user performed events like mouse movements, clicks, screen resizes and key presses. From this data, TrustedForm also calculates and stores other useful metadata like typing speed, time on page and more. To evaluate a certificate's metadata, customers can select and retrieve the specific items they wish via TrustedForm's Insights service.

Insights also provides page scan. In this feature, TrustedForm scans the web page for claimant-specified text. This is handy for ensuring that the web publisher has included the advertiser specified opt-in or privacy language on the page. It can be useful for detecting unwanted incentivizing language that the web publisher may have added. Here you see a web form on the left with consent language highlighted and on the right is part of TrustedForm's response indicating that the text it scanned for was found on the page.

TrustedForm provides the highest standard of user-experience documentation, with independent, secure collection and storage of the user experience. Every web page or mobile app that collects contact data should implement the TrustedForm script, and every business that handles that contact data should be claiming TrustedForm certificates.

# LeadConduit Pro Tip: An Easier Way to Work With Lists of Values in Rules

The LeadConduit UI lets you add or delete items to an “is included in” or “is not included in” rule’s RHV one at a time. This can be tedious when your list has more than a few items.

But here’s a handy short cut.

You can enter a comma-separated list into the RHV quickly by starting out your rule with the “is equal to” operator.

Next, enter your list of right-hand values as a comma-separated string. Don’t leave spaces before or after the commas, but if a single value contains a comma, enclose only that value in quotes.

Then simply change the rule operator to “is included in” or “is not included in” as desired. This works in reverse, too. You can revert from “is included in” to “is equal to” and back again is you need to edit or replace your list.

# TrustedForm Callback Function After the Certificate Is Inserted Into Your Form

Publishers may find it useful to have a callback fire after the TrustedForm script has inserted the Certificate URL into the form. The TrustedForm script supports this option by calling the global function named `trustedFormCertIdCallback` with a single argument, the TrustedForm Certificate ID. The `trustedFormCertUrlCallback` is also available if you want the full Certificate URL rather than just the ID.

In order to implement this callback, you must define the function `trustedFormCallback` before loading the TrustedForm script.

For example, this script will pop up two alert boxes with the ID and URL of the TrustedForm Certificate.

`    // the callback
    <script type=""text/javascript"">
      function trustedFormCertIdCallback(certificateId) {
        alert(""Certificate ID: "" + certificateId);
      }
      function trustedFormCertUrlCallback(certificateUrl) {
        alert(""Certificate URL: "" + certificateUrl);
      }
    </script>
    // the TrustedForm script wrapped in a function
    <script type=""text/javascript"">
    (function() {
    /*Place the core TrustedForm Script here`

`    Obtain the core script by clicking ` [`TrustedForm Web Script`](https://sso.activeprospect.com/trustedform/script) ` at https://activeprospect.com`

`    */`

`    })();
    </script>`

Please note, these callbacks are only fired _once_, regardless of how many forms the TrustedForm script inserts the Certificate URL into.

Each callback is strictly optional and can safely be ignored. If the callback functions are not defined, then the callback function is ignored by the TrustedForm script.

# TrustedForm Page Scan

TrustedForm can perform a real-time scan of lead generation forms to identify whether or not text specified by a user is present. The page scan works by searching the form's text that has been stored in a TrustedForm certificate. When you make a request to the TrustedForm service you are able to input the text snippet you would like to search for. The output will then include each supplied snippet and whether or not it was found. This can be used to ensure that leads were shown required text like disclosure languages, terms of service or intended data use are present or to filter out leads that were incentivized by free offers, part of deals with undesirable partners or unaware that you intend to contact them. As a best practice, when configuring page scan we highly recommend storing your text snippets in a single document that you can copy and paste from to avoid typing mistakes to have an easy to access record of the text you are scanning for.

**PLEASE NOTE:** TrustedForm Facebook Lead Ads certificates only supports page scan of the [custom disclaimer text](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1550411888622740?id=735435806665862) and checkbox questions.

# Page Scan using TrustedForm API

[Required scan terms](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v3.0/tag/Claiming-Certificates/#tag/Claiming-Certificates/operation/ClaimerWeb.ClaimController.create!path=required_scan_terms&t=request) or [forbidden scan terms](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v3.0/tag/Claiming-Certificates/#tag/Claiming-Certificates/operation/ClaimerWeb.ClaimController.create!path=forbidden_scan_terms&t=request) must be provided as parameters when the API request is made in order to use this feature. After this the results of which were found and not found will be returned in the API response. Visit [developers.activeprospect.com](https://developers.activeprospect.com/) for more information.

# Page Scan using LeadConduit

You can set required and/or forbidden text in the TrustedForm step in LeadConduit, to add TrustedForm step to your flow, follow the steps [here](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5098468-trustedform-leadconduit-add-on?_gl=1*ahjo2d*_gcl_au*MTI1NTg1MTA5NS4xNzM2NzgxNDA4LjE2Mjg3NTExMjQuMTczNzc0OTExOC4xNzM3NzQ5MTE4*_ga*NTQ3NjI0NDQxLjE3MzQ2Mzk3NDQ.*_ga_QHXBV6N7D1*MTczODAxNjEzMy4xNTIuMS4xNzM4MDE2NzUyLjM5LjAuMA..).

If you selects Insights, chose **Page Scan** data point to be appended to your flow. Once that is selected,  you'll be prompted to specify the Required and Forbidden texts in the subsequent configuration step.

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/786/623/original.png?f=1738017711&Expires=1748567781&Signature=N0q0tM-iPoVdez5zPN3Xw7~0sKeQ1hRJefQ5l3hIlD6k~-bkgbb-OmyZb-kg~gUxONEE0T6bD30eWtYnQrB~TfcRiOnNPGa6UWHhOxMXVtGgvPRjFwMbDi0fAgx7vxjR15e1SGtX2xHMmgTjEvSB97HKQOBxK~Vk0Z38uooVHUV87kGHgPFDP5SkLzD4s8tTCfdbhbMNkY5rq3las23XDEdmiG5u2wSvO7JSD~GgiDMt0N-1YQ9GeIVeItDMrm13Vhb0xdorpvPJ4ufHO33Ts-lK97ZyIaRiUSP770eO8Z1B6~gKJbPQRHbu0KeUfKvl9GCtRO0wYN-rGTHj2BvhHg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

You can specify them here, or do it later via the Edit Field Mappings button (you can add new or edit existing field mapping settings and define what you want to require or forbid), like shown below:

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/786/592/original.png?f=1738017288&Expires=1748567781&Signature=bj6snwpVdHKhFwKL8rCH~78tLUixvMWUvkWhlm3b4mOFcW~Pcq~oNo7qW7N1iJdL3NmAyYDZiI790C2YpIc9E4ohT8TGq0zszAPr9QVvukDysXRRGKJyFsYiKaT0sVo9aaADNrafEjQ-XYK1Rs0TD1YakRhyBR869Hv98TdCNdcNR9kuK93IquiVA2XXwdcP79CdIBpE-m7n6cXMBfJU-lIUkmHrzEtu8DCsosyyJQzBC8cJxce9n2CvrxEHlPK3G6uOiOwdMU2NARFHllzd~EBvLIIbabCnOGdY0oxCmMtr3gWD5-QuWxTjf651xiGJkd1l0XIebRo70ehSZJUy5w__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

In the example screenshot below, the required text is **solar** and **offer** and the forbidden text is **free**.

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/786/642/original.png?f=1738018422&Expires=1748567781&Signature=M-0VAXdTEx1sEEH-ZgBhNZ2lemf6ciYECUK606Rd16odBS1mOncQ9yO4OLnxIvvY293ZHHdDZ28jPTDdzWkq4JDfWPeFiYThUNVhH7ipBjHtzGb6-7e7dBl3cwCV9j89e~cxNvKFghFF-fP11zFPm1V9B4D1VcDIskj7S2XvgKPtdlj9bdCfVejevg2xOB-Nr06YxaJ7fCmITYaSRoP8TE0GftLm4dy0YXjknUC9RSSHO160lW-7lPn4YediLip8vsiRG1NzGiwNuZ7mA9Wr~wK9bVsxADn2jOs3Ms9FK8BHR2w9Ak8aoE8tsnO4GXUICO6Sr8L99jLn0ZcIEVkaYQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

If you set up a filter which uses the outcome of this step,  then you will fail all leads that were not generated from a page which contains **solar** AND **offer** but does not contain **free**.

If you would like to accept leads with **solar** OR **offer** (a.k.a. only fail leads when none of the required text is found) the filter must check that **Trustedform Amount Required Matched** is equal to none.

That filter looks like this:

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/786/682/original.png?f=1738019321&Expires=1748567781&Signature=cwN4KwrZ3O7SnzT-rO6JQoDIZ2P4CvGPnMp--nXekbfWgkQBWj24XIwyxc623JHd9BAEtlOdc4lufwBnPeEVsHb2xSewW48clnVMaqrsfvCauoha3IEb-a6jmrbGcuhvOyFX8PPiHrMaK4caE-COWgGSXYiAa1HNkCeeiK4jnYkl-v4bHscv3tU-sDrs6k2ILJ3x~goI7ePxHvgZfKmwMsSh2GbOw6NfIvneDBAYvc1i0jJF0DSc1Ce~hk4WEe5DTYKo4WoX5l8tUMfeTKRxGJJUiZWKPMQEPzbLzvGoafF2lrr~xnI0gOon5MPcK~EJ1V5a2zNq-QbhrjLnB1LLoQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

- Amount Required Matched: How many of the required strings were matched? (all, some, none)
- Amount Forbidden Matched: How many of the forbidden strings were scanned? (all, some, none)

**Example Scenarios**

**NOTE:** Required and Forbidden text ignores casing and multiple whitespaces, but the text must otherwise be an EXACT MATCH.

- **Scenario 1:** You configure the required text "" **Telemarketing** **CALLS**"" and the page has "" **Telemarketing** **calls**""
  - **Outcome:** **PASSES** the required text audit.

- **Scenario 2:** You configure the required text "" **Telemarketing** **CALLS**"" and the page has "" **Telemarketing** **calls**""
  - **Outcome:** **FAILS** the required text audit because there is a required white space between **Telemarketing** and **calls**

- **Scenario 3:** You require the text "" **prerecorded telemarketing calls.**"" and the page instead has "" **pre-recorded telemarketing calls!**""
  - **Outcome:** **FAILS** the required text audit because:

1. the hyphen in the text and
2. the exclamation mark instead of the period at the end of the text.

# TrustedForm Page Scan

TrustedForm can perform a real-time scan of lead generation forms to identify whether or not text specified by a user is present. The page scan works by searching the form's text that has been stored in a TrustedForm certificate. When you make a request to the TrustedForm service you are able to input the text snippet you would like to search for. The output will then include each supplied snippet and whether or not it was found. This can be used to ensure that leads were shown required text like disclosure languages, terms of service or intended data use are present or to filter out leads that were incentivized by free offers, part of deals with undesirable partners or unaware that you intend to contact them. As a best practice, when configuring page scan we highly recommend storing your text snippets in a single document that you can copy and paste from to avoid typing mistakes to have an easy to access record of the text you are scanning for.

**PLEASE NOTE:** TrustedForm Facebook Lead Ads certificates only supports page scan of the [custom disclaimer text](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1550411888622740?id=735435806665862) and checkbox questions.

# Page Scan using TrustedForm API

[Required scan terms](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v3.0/tag/Claiming-Certificates/#tag/Claiming-Certificates/operation/ClaimerWeb.ClaimController.create!path=required_scan_terms&t=request) or [forbidden scan terms](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v3.0/tag/Claiming-Certificates/#tag/Claiming-Certificates/operation/ClaimerWeb.ClaimController.create!path=forbidden_scan_terms&t=request) must be provided as parameters when the API request is made in order to use this feature. After this the results of which were found and not found will be returned in the API response. Visit [developers.activeprospect.com](https://developers.activeprospect.com/) for more information.

# Page Scan using LeadConduit

You can set required and/or forbidden text in the TrustedForm step in LeadConduit, to add TrustedForm step to your flow, follow the steps [here](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5098468-trustedform-leadconduit-add-on?_gl=1*ahjo2d*_gcl_au*MTI1NTg1MTA5NS4xNzM2NzgxNDA4LjE2Mjg3NTExMjQuMTczNzc0OTExOC4xNzM3NzQ5MTE4*_ga*NTQ3NjI0NDQxLjE3MzQ2Mzk3NDQ.*_ga_QHXBV6N7D1*MTczODAxNjEzMy4xNTIuMS4xNzM4MDE2NzUyLjM5LjAuMA..).

If you selects Insights, chose **Page Scan** data point to be appended to your flow. Once that is selected,  you'll be prompted to specify the Required and Forbidden texts in the subsequent configuration step.

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/786/623/original.png?f=1738017711&Expires=1748567782&Signature=eqYuCOzYhp00uYldFPullFQuDQqEtwnF~jvN2zgb0NKzdQ3D9sen7cmPb7JA1OpF~PCXWwIdB3waouJtU3qsEicDbmj6t~4gMQ-ky2OyITWoHKXKac112lPVKCTa4Tqq1Ggg8XYyx4kqsDrchnRzM3uSXvFv~JblLm7Q1r-YiC4yrdckMkdGX-b4AJWbs4wJUvSuX6tpVg5bhGJn5WyS9cS~V4wcNFXiq72HhsrMn5MKFk4ZhwZgnM1qiCZrtTIaSJwjOdix9RF~qVsdcvkkGBZ7FOXv4LbUxCgMdwmUVPkdvBjflMt0a~JEbGwCuiYIGWEkq13FMS1uyUR5vxqatg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

You can specify them here, or do it later via the Edit Field Mappings button (you can add new or edit existing field mapping settings and define what you want to require or forbid), like shown below:

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/786/592/original.png?f=1738017288&Expires=1748567782&Signature=gOThI17yV3g7-dN2ChY1sqUbftf5pXu-XpdYqasihPA1Lwx9gYa97pqoroP62Lg2tkD4Recq6yyF02SMpCfKXedOofGb8PpOUIoljBR5D3EAIIaMQxMJMV~QkFG0KgeTq1~FdQerEcNCJx3PUm2Z5S3O4KLQsQ1axbgnkzcIoi4en2dvF3OEJmxOfS40aPkOytXSshLM~aGL-LFGr9280dBg~XeDY-RHE1HRmkqTK~xijLofLioujwXDk-Dvakhs4lMTTgX5yt9~g66JVhtc-7U2qD76Fgsol-yt5E581AwGTR0EhED2mrrnkRGicfNQjKwF0~SqesL0ZfmQA84Rug__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

In the example screenshot below, the required text is **solar** and **offer** and the forbidden text is **free**.

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/786/642/original.png?f=1738018422&Expires=1748567782&Signature=s2IBmRVQJ6iOoBp1VqizWdJjajnKUHcu0OXMnw2TARv19nq-ln3LI3YxwzGM~m5HdDVdAj1vXg-QWYKYIb8tnKHK8D0W3hsbB--MRHn-6lKbqwL9p8ismNvVGO~-Qsdx6DY8oMD02TSurw7ZL4tp6xLrVEtn~~y0BfXgWlo9TrG~fh4r2J0gLkaprkE686AK0V0DSNoaF~c4oI1EiadP45VQ0dDQXMAfd~8wM4qbBDRe22v8WsUftrsWe-NGECp0xAC5nXMmAsQwLtBkiWUAB96coAELT67Xd7~bDF6f6sDoRTxhLSbJldxIWo7D73WTrDlaFj4zV~91V0wPIvbytg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

If you set up a filter which uses the outcome of this step,  then you will fail all leads that were not generated from a page which contains **solar** AND **offer** but does not contain **free**.

If you would like to accept leads with **solar** OR **offer** (a.k.a. only fail leads when none of the required text is found) the filter must check that **Trustedform Amount Required Matched** is equal to none.

That filter looks like this:

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/786/682/original.png?f=1738019321&Expires=1748567782&Signature=lI7G4n~Dz-wVyBiHBwAGY5sr3ZaO~cs34sj1rKeD6EJF5-jaMr-mUtFeBdA2Q-NMaw6dBeA9K7NT8mg7rG8s~zBBC2L0ciWNFVUwKfBf3JEUyesZihj3HJBAZzc1Yl29QJOctaw~PEdgEc3Ngpgtn78WPBsRoFP8YH0K7LR~Vf0ZPhX1Xp5~xW9uyfN5KWrFlJdtdxP5f6btQchAUcCs9xJmwUEEiPlFGwQJxWFLB82GGf0ZjIpCiAwu~Z~3A66d9lkn3MPk4K6a6rGKZtOa~9FUu9bMTkKnCM2Ptu~84V~xvo~IVAqcrsidioPIz~94TqVTbP4VE6mP9FlpKYGA-w__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

- Amount Required Matched: How many of the required strings were matched? (all, some, none)
- Amount Forbidden Matched: How many of the forbidden strings were scanned? (all, some, none)

**Example Scenarios**

**NOTE:** Required and Forbidden text ignores casing and multiple whitespaces, but the text must otherwise be an EXACT MATCH.

- **Scenario 1:** You configure the required text "" **Telemarketing** **CALLS**"" and the page has "" **Telemarketing** **calls**""
  - **Outcome:** **PASSES** the required text audit.

- **Scenario 2:** You configure the required text "" **Telemarketing** **CALLS**"" and the page has "" **Telemarketing** **calls**""
  - **Outcome:** **FAILS** the required text audit because there is a required white space between **Telemarketing** and **calls**

- **Scenario 3:** You require the text "" **prerecorded telemarketing calls.**"" and the page instead has "" **pre-recorded telemarketing calls!**""
  - **Outcome:** **FAILS** the required text audit because:

1. the hyphen in the text and
2. the exclamation mark instead of the period at the end of the text.

# TrustedForm: How to use API version 4.0

TrustedForm Certificate API v4.0 is the latest and recommended version when using the TrustedForm product offering. View [Introducing TrustedForm Certificate API v4.0](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5066720-introducing-trustedform-certificate-api-v4-0) for more details about what's new. All self-service customers using older versions must make changes to their API requests to begin using v4.0 by **January 1, 2024**.

Professional and Enterprise customers who would like to use it should contact their client success manager to gain access before making an attempt. Below are a few easy steps to help you make the necessary changes.

**1\. Add ""api-version: 4.0"" as a HTTP header to your existing request**

The [api-version header](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Certificate-URL/#tag/Certificate-URL/operation/runOperations!in=header&path=api-version&t=request) is how the TrustedForm Certificate API determines which version of the request/response structure to use to interpret and process your request. You will only have access to the support versions released after the version your account is configured to use. You can check this by visiting [https://app.trustedform.com/settings](https://app.trustedform.com/settings?__hstc=41051389.0ba01f68f6f018203e0997bea47cdc97.1748564186854.1748564186854.1748564186854.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564186854&__hsfp=3707738794).

​x

1

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

2

```
Authorization: Basic ************************************************
```

3

```
Api-Version: 4.0
```

**2\. Add the** [**retain**](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Retain/#tag/Retain/schema/RetainParameters) **and** [**match\_lead**](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Match-Lead/#tag/Match-Lead/schema/MatchLeadParameters) **objects to your request body**

One of the biggest changes in v4.0 is that you must now pass the operations you would like to execute as part of your request. This enables us to expand the operations you are able to perform and offer new products as part of the same API over time. As a self service customer you currently only have access to the Retain product. View the [retain operation section of our API documentation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Retain/) for details on how to format your request. Please include both the match\_lead and retain operation in your request, as in the following example of a payload:

```
xxxxxxxxxx
```

1

10

1

```
{
```

2

```
  ""match_lead"": {
```

3

```
    ""email"": ""consumeremail@gmail.com"",
```

4

```
    ""phone"": ""3033294595""
```

5

```
  },
```

6

```
  ""retain"": {
```

7

```
    ""reference"": ""Weblead"",
```

8

```
    ""vendor"": ""Vendor Name""
```

9

```
  }
```

10

```
}
```

**3\. Make any necessary adjustments to your integration**

If you were previously ingesting any information from the response provided by the TrustedForm Certificate API please see the new Retain Response in the [retain operation section of our API documentation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Retain/) and use the new path to retrieve the properties you want. We recommend using the [outcome](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Certificate-URL/#tag/Certificate-URL/operation/runOperations!c=200&path=outcome&t=response) property to determine your next steps. You can find our [full API documentation here](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/getting-started/).

When outcome is...

**""success""** \- No action is necessary. The certificate has been retained in your account.

**""failure""** \- The certificate has been retained in your account but as failed to meet best practices. Please review the value in the ""reason"" property and manually review the certificate before contacting your lead.

**""error""** \- The certificate could not be retained. Please review the value in the ""reason"" property for an explanation, correct the problem and try again.

**That's it! Now you are using version 4.0 of the TrustedForm Certificate API.**

# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Will versions 2.0 and 3.0 stop working?**

Yes previous versions will be sunset and no longer available after **December 31** **st, 2023 for Self-Service customers**. If you're in this group you should have received an email notification explaining this.

2. **How does this affect self-service pricing?**

Your pricing for API usage will not change until you start using version 4.0. The product offering in the v4.0 API is different, with different pricing.  Depending on your needs and usage, your costs may vary.

Customers using v2.0 will be switching from a flat fee per certificate to our tiered structure. Once your volume reaches the higher tier you'll find that your unit cost becomes lower than it currently is.

Customers using v3.0 are already being charged based on our tiered structure but will now have the opportunity to received a discounted rate for certificate generated from their [verified domains](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4649879-verify-domain-ownership)!

Visit [https://activeprospect.com/pricing](https://activeprospect.com/pricing/?_gl=1*1tpu3vi*_ga*MTU1NjIxNDM1NC4xNjQyNzkzOTI2*_ga_QHXBV6N7D1*MTY5MDg5OTQ5MC4yNTUuMS4xNjkwODk5NjE2LjIuMC4w) for more details.

3. **How do I access to lead event data like IP address, originating domain, lead age, etc.?**

These data points were included for self service customers using v2.0. Now they have become part of the [TrustedForm Insights](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4709758-trustedform-insights) product. To purchase Insights [submit your information](https://activeprospect.com/pricing/#form) to be contacted by our sales team.

4. **How do I access the page scan feature?**

Page scan has also become a part of the [TrustedForm Insights](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4709758-trustedform-insights) product. To purchase Insights [submit your information](https://activeprospect.com/pricing/#form) to be contacted by our sales team.

5. **If I switch API versions mid-month how does that affect my self service pricing tier?**

When you switch API versions you will be using a new product, so your pricing tier will be reset. To avoid missing out on any lower pricing that you have qualified for we recommend switching your api-version at the beginning of the month.

6. **Does it require a different javascript snippet to record?**

No. The Certificate API does is not related to this.

# Extended Retention Window for Submitted Leads

TLDR; By default certificates are only available to retained for 3 days. If a submission event is detected this gets extended to 90 days.

Once a certificate has been created, there is a limited window of time after which the certificate can no longer be retained. If you are planning to retain a certificate in long-term storage, you must do so before this retention window expires.

TrustedForm now extends the period a certificate is eligible to be retained if a submit event is detected on its lead generation form. By default certificates are only able to be retained for 3 days following their creation. This creates problems when you purchase aged leads / warm transfers as you often obtain the lead data after the retention period has ended. This means you miss out on having the opportunity to store the certificate and be protected. Extended certificates are able to be retained for 90 days which should give you more than enough time to retain relevant TrustedForm certificates. Prior to this change the only ways to extend a certificate required that you reach out to your lead vendor so they could implement the necessary steps to extend certificates. Now this happens automatically for leads that TrustedForm can validate were submitted!

## How it Works

TrustedForm Certify has been updated with new abilities that allow it to listen for events that explicitly indicate a form has been submitted or are associated with elements on a page that behave like a submit button. Certify is expected to accurately capture these submit events from any webpage using a standard <form> tag with a submit button embedded inside of it. Unfortunately, when publishers use less conventional means to submit lead data these events become more obscured and may not be caught. If a submission event is detected with high confidence, TrustedForm will automatically send this event and trigger the process to extend the certificate. We have observed that ~80% of certificates acknowledged to contain submitted leads are automatically extended. This process will take at least 15 minutes before it begins to ensure that all user activity is captured. Once it is complete you will see a longer time until the certificate is deleted if you visit the certificate URL before retaining it.

## Caveats

- Using the expiration of certificates as a means to avoid purchasing aged leads is no longer a reliable solution.

- The format of certain forms may prevent TrustedForm Certify from capturing submit event data.

- If a certificate does not get extended, that should not be considered a definitive indicator that the form wasn’t submitted.

- Certificate extension does not happen immediately after the lead submits their data which could lead to false assumptions that the certificate will not be extended.

- Certificates generated from Facebook Lead Ads always have a 12 week retention window.


## Frequently Asked Questions

- **How can I avoid reaching out to old leads that weren't generated recently?**

Check the lead age on TrustedForm certificates to determine if the lead was created recently.
- **How can I tell if Certify is detecting submit events for my certificates?**

View one a certificate for a lead from each of the forms you want to check. View the Event Log and search for ""submitted form"" event. If this event exists then it means a form submission was successfully captured.

- **What can I do to make sure that the certificates I generate get extended?**

Reach out to support@activeprospect.com if certificates you generate are not being extended automatically and you would like to troubleshoot why.
- **I just received a certificate and it says it will be deleted in 2 days, is this feature working?**

Wait at least one hour after the certificate was generated before expecting to see an extended deletion date on the TrustedForm certificate UI. If the certificate has not been extended after this period have your vendor reach out to us so we can help them troubleshoot.

# TrustedForm Lead Matching

Lead matching allows you to confirm that a TrustedForm certificate contains input that matches the contact information for your lead.

**Beginning July 5, 2023 TrustedForm certificates began hiding all form input data in session replays until lead matching is performed if a lead's email address or phone number is recorded by the certificate as part of our new Enhanced PII Protection. [Read more](https://activeprospect.com/blog/trustedform-new-data-security-enhancement/).**

# Overview

If you buy a lead with the (123) 456-7890 as their phone number but the TrustedForm certificate shows that (555) 555-5555 was entered as their phone number wouldn't you want to know? TrustedForm's matching feature is designed to empower you to identify cases like this and ensure your certificates match with their lead. If you don't you are making your business susceptible to [lead fraud](https://activeprospect.com/blog/what-is-lead-fraud/).

As TrustedForm collects user input from the page, form data matching an email address or phone number is securely hashed and stored with the certificate. When you make a request to the TrustedForm Certificate API, you can pass your lead's email address and/or phone number as parameters in the request. TrustedForm compares the values stored within the certificate with the values passed in the request and the response tells you whether or not they match.

View the API documentation base on the API version you are using to automate this:

- [Version 4.0: Use the Match Lead operation to perform lead matching.](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Match-Lead/)
- [Version 3.0: Use the fingerprints request parameter to perform lead matching](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v3.0/tag/Claiming-Certificates/#tag/Claiming-Certificates/operation/ClaimerWeb.ClaimController.create!path=fingerprints&t=request)
- [Version 2.0:](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v2.0/tag/Claiming-Certificates/#tag/Claiming-Certificates/operation/ClaimerWeb.ClaimController.create!path=fingerprints&t=request) [Use the fingerprints request parameter to perform lead matching](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v2.0/tag/Claiming-Certificates/#tag/Claiming-Certificates/operation/ClaimerWeb.ClaimController.create!path=fingerprints&t=request)

When none of the values match it means that the certificate does not prove that you have consent to contact that lead. In response you should do one or more of the following:

- Classify this lead as non-compliant and take proper precautions to avoid litigation (e.g. reject the lead)
- Manually review the TrustedForm certificate's session replay to make your own determination of whether you have been given consent to contact this lead.
- Reach out to your lead vendor and ask them to only send you leads where the TrustedForm certificate shows the consumer inputting their contact information.

# Certificate Match Statuses

TrustedForm Certificates can have one of four possible statuses with regards to lead matching:

1. Matched - Lead matching was performed and the lead data you supplied matched lead data found in the certificate. This happens automatically for certificates generated from one of your [verified domains](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4649879-verify-domain-ownership) as these are first party leads where the data source for the certificate and lead are the same.
2. Not Matched - Lead matching was performed but the lead data you supplied **DID NOT** match lead data found in the certificate.
3. Match Not Possible- Lead matching is not possible because no lead data could be found in the certificate.
4. Match Not Attempted - Lead matching is possible but has not been performed yet.

# What Fingerprinting means in Software

In the non-digital world fingerprint identification is a reliable way to match archived records to a person so law enforcement or other agencies can identify who they are. [Fingerprinting in software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20fingerprinting,uniquely%20identify%20people%20for%20practical) works in a similar way but instead of storing actual fingerprints it stores unique data about a person such as their contact information in the form of a digital fingerprint. TrustedForm certificates detect any email addresses or phone numbers entered in form fields and stores a secure version of them that can be used to identify if a lead matches our records.

# Technical Details of the Mechanics of Matching in TrustedForm

During the marketing process consumers are often taken to a page with a form for collecting their contact data. Here TrustedForm Certify runs in the background to create a TrustedForm certificate and begins checking for any email address or phone numbers. [Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) are used to search the source code and user interactions for patterns that match contact information.

```
/[\+]?[(]?[0-9]{3}[)]?[-\s\.]?[0-9]{3}[-\s\.]?[0-9]{4,6}/
Regular expression used to detect phone numbers
```

```
/^[^,@\s]+@[-\w]+\.[a-z]{2,}$/
Regular expression used to detect email addresses
```

This means any emails or phone numbers found on the the web page or entered into form fields should be found and will be converted into a SHA1 hash to be stored as part of the certificate.

In addition to using regular expressions to search for contact information, TrustedForm also leverages consent tags to capture phone numbers and email addresses from various form elements, including those outside of traditional form fields (such as in consent text). Any form elements tagged with **consent-grantor-phone** or **consent-grantor-email** will have their values captured as fingerprints, which can then be used in match lead requests to enhance the lead verification process, ensuring more comprehensive and accurate lead matching.

For detailed instructions on how to implement and configure these consent tags, refer to our [developer documentation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/consent-tagging/).

|     |
| --- |
| **Example of a phone number converted to a SHA1 hash:** |
| (512)555-1234 -> 60BFA1AD1B29521A7014B95157A2128DCD092E11 |

Before being converted to a hash to be stored, emails and phones are normalized. Email are simply downcased while  phone numbers remove all whitespace, hyphens, brackets and parenthesis. This normalization is also applied to the values of lead matching parameters to help legitimate matches be made when the formatting is different.

## Qualifying Phone Numbers

TrustedForm Certify considers data to be a phone number when it meets the following criteria:

- It is in a field whose name doesn’t reference “postal,” “zip,” “IP addr,” or “time.”
- The field doesn’t contain alphabetical characters.
- The field contains at least three consecutive numbers.
- The field, when  stripped of everything but numbers, is 10 digits , or 11 digits if it includes the country code '1' .
- The field is an NANP phone number (a 10-digit phone number used in North America, the Caribbean, and some Pacific territories).

## Qualifying Email Addresses

TrustedForm Certify considers any @ symbol with text on both sides to be an email address.

# Checking for Matches

When a customer makes a request to the TrustedForm Certificate API, they have the option to have TrustedForm check the contact information between the certificate and that of the lead data. There are two options to do this:

## Requests via LeadConduit

TrustedForm enhancement steps use the standard email and phone fields to perform lead matching and append the results to the lead by default. You can map custom values to the Lead Email, Lead Phone 1, Lead Phone 2 or Lead Phone 3 fields to override this behavior.

## Request directly via the TrustedForm API

Customers can pass email addresses, phone numbers or SHA1 hash values of the same, as described in the [Match Lead Operation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Match-Lead/).

# Possible Outcomes

Values passed will be classified as either matching or non-matching. When all values match you can be confident that the certificate belongs with your lead. If not, you should review the certificate's session replay to confirm the data entered in the replay matches the data submitted and investigate why no matches were found.

Here are a few examples of why this might occur to help with the troubleshooting process:

- **The email(s) or phone number(s) entered into the form do not match the data provided in the request.**

The certificate doesn’t match the lead for some reason. If emails or phone numbers don't match, there's a chance that the lead seller is providing an invalid cert. For example, a seller may provide customer information with a previously generated certificate for a different customer.
- **The form didn't generate any fingerprints.**

This happens if the script doesn’t detect any populated email or phone number fields, which could happen if a vendor has a dynamic form and initializes the TrustedForm script at a later step when the consumer’s personal information is no longer on the page.
- **The request included a typo or improperly hashed values.**

Lead matching only works if you supply the correct values. If your request includes a typo then that is what will be used and it won't result in a match. Or if you are hashing values before including them in the request make sure you are correctly generating the SHA1 hash for each email address and phone number they’re trying to match.

# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Does matching cost extra?**

No, it is included with the TrustedForm base subscription.
2. **Does TrustedForm support fingerprinting on the ping?**

Yes, when using the TrustedForm Insights product you can perform matching on the ping.
3. **Does a mismatched fingerprint guarantee my lead is fraudulent?**

No, Matching isn't foolproof. It is a useful signal to flag leads for further auditing. We recommend you perform an investigation and only reject leads using this after you have noticed a pattern and worked with your vendor to resolve it.
4. **Can I hash my matching inputs to avoid send raw values across the web?**

Yes, you can use SHA1 to hash your values before sending them in your API request. TrustedForm will recognize this and still be able to use to values to perform matching.
5. **Does lead matching work on masked certificates?**

Yes, lead matching work with masked certificates. Though with [masked certificates](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4889858-what-is-a-masked-trustedform-certificate), you do not see the session replay or event log.

# Adding a Source

# The Basics

You can add data sources to your flow using the flow editor.

From the flow's edit mode, click on the **Sources** tab, and then the **Add Source** button in the upper right corner.

In the **Select a Source or Integration** menu you will find the list of existing sources and integrations.

There are four types of Sources:

1. Default - Each flow has a default source labeled with your account name
2. Standard - Lead vendors familiar with the ActiveProspect platform
3. Account - LeadConduit account holders who opted to be listed
4. Custom - Lead sources defined by you and specific to your account e.g.
   - Your web forms
   - Twilio numbers routed through LeadConduit
   - Vendors unfamiliar with LeadConduit
   - Other non-standard use cases

In the **Select a Source or Integration** menu you can:

- Search for or scroll through the list of existing sources and integrations
- Create a new custom source, specific to your account

# Adding a New Custom Source

We only recommend creating a custom source if your source does not exist in the standard source library. When creating a new custom source you will select the type of integration it will use by default in this flow:

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/386/252/original.png?f=1606867612&Expires=1748567784&Signature=vJHUqtEyfDEukYFsY7veWBVtc19C9ShqBxplIR-jva0oAk3BKrc2Z3e1afMqEFBxrCCrGXPJ2-dmJG~I-2L-wnkZDYzuzWr5cwQv9vefL7FGHleD1gHi86vaL4jGZnWW-b8SuOAtrbh79R4iY3vlivg6Bud8taWo6mtQ9JAONtH7FuXL8OtO7DuAKnP0QR1LORxP1toIhM4Pn7jjBRKVo9cRdJGBaWicOP1OZ1AmmwLSkc385AzUdi6hnKgRyoZV2-Ntco0~S7B7ujQSsNjSuqLkuzzyGv4qbzJlH-k8YSvCNqpGwfS6sRF~EHKAD5O3Azfm86lXmQVifZBKcx0C5A__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

If you later need to change a custom source's integration type, you can edit the source in the sources library to make additional integrations available, then in your flow re-select which of those integrations will apply in that flow.

# Adding a New Web Form Source

If you want to use an existing web form as a source, and if you know the url of that form's web page, LeadConduit may be able to automatically configure the source from your web form by reading the web page itself.

First, check the sources list to be sure that you haven't already used that web form as a source for a different flow. _There's no need to create a new web form source if one already exists._

To create a new web form source, enter the web form page's url into the ""Enter Your Webform URL"" box (""D"") and follow the prompts. This option works best with simple HTML forms. Results are unpredictable with forms that are created and managed by form-generating applications or forms that are submitted via javascript:

# Adding an Account Source to Your Flow

**Sources** receive lead data and can include:

- Your Landing Pages
- Your Favorite Lead Vendor
- A LeadConduit Account Holder

All Sources in LeadConduit have a tag to tell you whether they are an Account Source, a Standard Source, or a Custom Source.

#### Add The Source

**For another LeadConduit Account Holder** to send you leads, you'll need to add the Account as a Source in the LeadConduit flow of your choice. You can search for the Account or scroll through the list.

Once the Account has been added as a Source to your flow and saved, you need to send instructions (Submission Instructions) to your contact at the source so they can adjust their forms/systems to send lead data to LeadConduit at the URL and in a format that your LeadConduit flow accepts.

#### Send Submission Instructions to the Source

LeadConduit automatically generates a web-based submission instructions document specifically tailored to each Flow and Source. This document provides the correct URL to which to post the lead data, the fields that the flow accepts (both required and optional), an outline of that source's acceptance criteria logic, examples of an allowable request body, shown in LeadConduit's recognized data structure formats: Json, www/formurlencoded, and XML, and examples of LeadConduit response bodies for both success and failure outcomes.

Find the link to each source's Submission Instructions in the Flow ""Sources"" tab, as an icon in line with the Source name. Click on the icon to view the Submission Instructions document, then copy the document's URL from your browser address bar. Provide this URL to your Source contact, and be sure to tell them that this link is a link to their Submission Instructions document and that is it NOT actual submit URL for their form/system. That link is provided inside the document.

NOTE: Each source's Submission Instructions are unique, for each flow and Source. Do not use a different Source's Submission Instructions.

Once they configure their form/system to according to the Submission Instructions document, the Source Account Holder will be able to send leads to your Flow. You're good to go!

**For more details, search this knowledge base for ""Submission Instructions"".**

# TrustedForm Lead Matching

Lead matching allows you to confirm that a TrustedForm certificate contains input that matches the contact information for your lead.

**Beginning July 5, 2023 TrustedForm certificates began hiding all form input data in session replays until lead matching is performed if a lead's email address or phone number is recorded by the certificate as part of our new Enhanced PII Protection. [Read more](https://activeprospect.com/blog/trustedform-new-data-security-enhancement/).**

# Overview

If you buy a lead with the (123) 456-7890 as their phone number but the TrustedForm certificate shows that (555) 555-5555 was entered as their phone number wouldn't you want to know? TrustedForm's matching feature is designed to empower you to identify cases like this and ensure your certificates match with their lead. If you don't you are making your business susceptible to [lead fraud](https://activeprospect.com/blog/what-is-lead-fraud/).

As TrustedForm collects user input from the page, form data matching an email address or phone number is securely hashed and stored with the certificate. When you make a request to the TrustedForm Certificate API, you can pass your lead's email address and/or phone number as parameters in the request. TrustedForm compares the values stored within the certificate with the values passed in the request and the response tells you whether or not they match.

View the API documentation base on the API version you are using to automate this:

- [Version 4.0: Use the Match Lead operation to perform lead matching.](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Match-Lead/)
- [Version 3.0: Use the fingerprints request parameter to perform lead matching](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v3.0/tag/Claiming-Certificates/#tag/Claiming-Certificates/operation/ClaimerWeb.ClaimController.create!path=fingerprints&t=request)
- [Version 2.0:](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v2.0/tag/Claiming-Certificates/#tag/Claiming-Certificates/operation/ClaimerWeb.ClaimController.create!path=fingerprints&t=request) [Use the fingerprints request parameter to perform lead matching](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v2.0/tag/Claiming-Certificates/#tag/Claiming-Certificates/operation/ClaimerWeb.ClaimController.create!path=fingerprints&t=request)

When none of the values match it means that the certificate does not prove that you have consent to contact that lead. In response you should do one or more of the following:

- Classify this lead as non-compliant and take proper precautions to avoid litigation (e.g. reject the lead)
- Manually review the TrustedForm certificate's session replay to make your own determination of whether you have been given consent to contact this lead.
- Reach out to your lead vendor and ask them to only send you leads where the TrustedForm certificate shows the consumer inputting their contact information.

# Certificate Match Statuses

TrustedForm Certificates can have one of four possible statuses with regards to lead matching:

1. Matched - Lead matching was performed and the lead data you supplied matched lead data found in the certificate. This happens automatically for certificates generated from one of your [verified domains](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4649879-verify-domain-ownership) as these are first party leads where the data source for the certificate and lead are the same.
2. Not Matched - Lead matching was performed but the lead data you supplied **DID NOT** match lead data found in the certificate.
3. Match Not Possible- Lead matching is not possible because no lead data could be found in the certificate.
4. Match Not Attempted - Lead matching is possible but has not been performed yet.

# What Fingerprinting means in Software

In the non-digital world fingerprint identification is a reliable way to match archived records to a person so law enforcement or other agencies can identify who they are. [Fingerprinting in software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint_(computing)#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20fingerprinting,uniquely%20identify%20people%20for%20practical) works in a similar way but instead of storing actual fingerprints it stores unique data about a person such as their contact information in the form of a digital fingerprint. TrustedForm certificates detect any email addresses or phone numbers entered in form fields and stores a secure version of them that can be used to identify if a lead matches our records.

# Technical Details of the Mechanics of Matching in TrustedForm

During the marketing process consumers are often taken to a page with a form for collecting their contact data. Here TrustedForm Certify runs in the background to create a TrustedForm certificate and begins checking for any email address or phone numbers. [Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) are used to search the source code and user interactions for patterns that match contact information.

```
/[\+]?[(]?[0-9]{3}[)]?[-\s\.]?[0-9]{3}[-\s\.]?[0-9]{4,6}/
Regular expression used to detect phone numbers
```

```
/^[^,@\s]+@[-\w]+\.[a-z]{2,}$/
Regular expression used to detect email addresses
```

This means any emails or phone numbers found on the the web page or entered into form fields should be found and will be converted into a SHA1 hash to be stored as part of the certificate.

In addition to using regular expressions to search for contact information, TrustedForm also leverages consent tags to capture phone numbers and email addresses from various form elements, including those outside of traditional form fields (such as in consent text). Any form elements tagged with **consent-grantor-phone** or **consent-grantor-email** will have their values captured as fingerprints, which can then be used in match lead requests to enhance the lead verification process, ensuring more comprehensive and accurate lead matching.

For detailed instructions on how to implement and configure these consent tags, refer to our [developer documentation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/consent-tagging/).

|     |
| --- |
| **Example of a phone number converted to a SHA1 hash:** |
| (512)555-1234 -> 60BFA1AD1B29521A7014B95157A2128DCD092E11 |

Before being converted to a hash to be stored, emails and phones are normalized. Email are simply downcased while  phone numbers remove all whitespace, hyphens, brackets and parenthesis. This normalization is also applied to the values of lead matching parameters to help legitimate matches be made when the formatting is different.

## Qualifying Phone Numbers

TrustedForm Certify considers data to be a phone number when it meets the following criteria:

- It is in a field whose name doesn’t reference “postal,” “zip,” “IP addr,” or “time.”
- The field doesn’t contain alphabetical characters.
- The field contains at least three consecutive numbers.
- The field, when  stripped of everything but numbers, is 10 digits , or 11 digits if it includes the country code '1' .
- The field is an NANP phone number (a 10-digit phone number used in North America, the Caribbean, and some Pacific territories).

## Qualifying Email Addresses

TrustedForm Certify considers any @ symbol with text on both sides to be an email address.

# Checking for Matches

When a customer makes a request to the TrustedForm Certificate API, they have the option to have TrustedForm check the contact information between the certificate and that of the lead data. There are two options to do this:

## Requests via LeadConduit

TrustedForm enhancement steps use the standard email and phone fields to perform lead matching and append the results to the lead by default. You can map custom values to the Lead Email, Lead Phone 1, Lead Phone 2 or Lead Phone 3 fields to override this behavior.

## Request directly via the TrustedForm API

Customers can pass email addresses, phone numbers or SHA1 hash values of the same, as described in the [Match Lead Operation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Match-Lead/).

# Possible Outcomes

Values passed will be classified as either matching or non-matching. When all values match you can be confident that the certificate belongs with your lead. If not, you should review the certificate's session replay to confirm the data entered in the replay matches the data submitted and investigate why no matches were found.

Here are a few examples of why this might occur to help with the troubleshooting process:

- **The email(s) or phone number(s) entered into the form do not match the data provided in the request.**

The certificate doesn’t match the lead for some reason. If emails or phone numbers don't match, there's a chance that the lead seller is providing an invalid cert. For example, a seller may provide customer information with a previously generated certificate for a different customer.
- **The form didn't generate any fingerprints.**

This happens if the script doesn’t detect any populated email or phone number fields, which could happen if a vendor has a dynamic form and initializes the TrustedForm script at a later step when the consumer’s personal information is no longer on the page.
- **The request included a typo or improperly hashed values.**

Lead matching only works if you supply the correct values. If your request includes a typo then that is what will be used and it won't result in a match. Or if you are hashing values before including them in the request make sure you are correctly generating the SHA1 hash for each email address and phone number they’re trying to match.

# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Does matching cost extra?**

No, it is included with the TrustedForm base subscription.
2. **Does TrustedForm support fingerprinting on the ping?**

Yes, when using the TrustedForm Insights product you can perform matching on the ping.
3. **Does a mismatched fingerprint guarantee my lead is fraudulent?**

No, Matching isn't foolproof. It is a useful signal to flag leads for further auditing. We recommend you perform an investigation and only reject leads using this after you have noticed a pattern and worked with your vendor to resolve it.
4. **Can I hash my matching inputs to avoid send raw values across the web?**

Yes, you can use SHA1 to hash your values before sending them in your API request. TrustedForm will recognize this and still be able to use to values to perform matching.
5. **Does lead matching work on masked certificates?**

Yes, lead matching work with masked certificates. Though with [masked certificates](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4889858-what-is-a-masked-trustedform-certificate), you do not see the session replay or event log.

# TrustedForm Insights

Insights is a TrustedForm product that allows you to retrieve a wide range of metadata that gives you the capacity to gain an intuitive understanding of your leads. Using a TrustedForm Certificate URL you are able to make a simple API call that will return information you need to:

- Increase your conversion rate

- Lower your cost per lead

- Make efficient bids in ping/post auctions

- [Optimize](https://activeprospect.com/resources/lead-optimization-wp-lp/) your your lead purchasing strategy

- And more!


# How It Works

Ask your lead vendors to use [TrustedForm Certify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/certify/) and send a TrustedForm Certificate URL along with the lead. Then use our [API to retrieve insights](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v3.0/tag/Retrieving-Insights/) for your lead and send them to the system you use to make purchasing decisions. Search for correlations with your disposition data and use this information to set acceptance criteria, filters, bids and routing destinations that progress your business goals.

# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **How do I get access to TrustedForm Insights?**

Contact your account administrator or sales@activepropsect.com for purchase.

2. **Will this allow me to view and retain TrustedForm certificates?**

No, in order to view TrustedForm certificates you must v [erify that you own the domain it originated from](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4649879-verify-domain-ownership) or use TrustedForm Retain to store the certificate in your account.

3. **How long am I able to use TrustedForm Insights to retrieve metadata from a TrustedForm certificate?**

For all certificates, until the TrustedForm certificate's claim period expires (3 or 90 days). All certificates expire, regardless of whether they were retained or not. Retaining it means even after it’s expired, you’ll still have a copy stored in your account. Once a certificate expires, you can no longer perform any operations or make any requests on it.

4. **If I have both the TrustedForm Insights and Trusted Consent products how can I retrieve the metadata without retaining the certificate in my account?**

Using a [ping API request](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v3.0/tag/Ping/) will do this as certificates are not expected to be retained during the ping (bidding phase of ping/post auctions).

5. **How can I retrieve insights for certificates in bulk?**

In order to do this you must store the properties included in the TrustedForm API response in a CRM or other system designed to store data and retrieve it from there.

6. **What information can I acquire using TrustedForm Insights?**

See the offerings from our products below or the [Data available through TrustedForm Insights](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4112140-data-available-through-trustedform-insights) post!

# TrustedForm Certify Failure Reasons

Are there any specific reasons as to why a TrustedForm certificate wouldn't be created and therefore the URL wouldn't be captured?

Yes, as with any product there's always the possibility for something to go wrong that causes it not to work. The known scenarios that would prevent a TrustedForm certificate URL from being created are:

- The consumer is preventing TrustedForm Certify from running by using a browser or ad blocker extension that uses a filter list which has flagged TrustedForm code. Make sure your implementation of the Web SDK does not include the ""provide\_referrer"" parameter as this is specifically targeted by [EasyList's EasyPrivacy list](https://easylist.to/) , the most notable filter list which powers [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/), [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/), [AdBlock](https://getadblock.com/), [AdGuard](https://adguard.com/), [Brave](https://brave.com/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/) and other ad blockers.
- Google Tag Manager was used to implement TrustedForm Certify and is being blocked.
- The consumer disables JavaScript from running on their browser.
- The consumer has a bad internet connection that causes the TrustedForm Certify to fail, timeout or take so long that the form gets submitted before it is created.
- A bot fills out the form and doesn't trigger TrustedForm Certify.
- The TrustedForm Certify is implemented incorrectly.
  - It gets initiated before the form is added to the page
  - The page has other scripts that must run before the TrustedForm Certify and the form is submitted before it gets its turn.
- ActiveProspect has an outage or a bug in the TrustedForm Certify.

# Manually Triggering TrustedForm Certify Web SDK(Delayed Execution)

The following article covers technical guidance to trigger the TrustedForm Certify Web SDK. We suggest you use this method only if you want to avoid recording data until a specific event on your web page or flow happens. This may be use as way to collect consent before recording, trim the session replay or ensure your page has loaded first to reduce the SDK's impact on site performance.

**This article assumes you're familiar with HTML, Javascript, and jQuery.**

By wrapping the TrustedForm Certify javascript snippet in a function, you make it available to be called by a specific action later - simply trigger the function:

```
function beginTrustedFormRecording() {
// Get the TrustedForm Certify javascript snippet at
// https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/certify/
}
```

When recording begins, it collects the current state of the webpage's Document Object Model (DOM). We recommend that you coordinate this function to execute before the user begins completing required fields, or with the loading of a pop-up window that displays the disclosure language so that important events are captured.

It is important to note that you need to give the TrustedForm Certify Web SDK time to load and populate the TrustedForm Certificate URL field. Usually, this happens in under a second but you should never try to call the begin recording AND submit your form at the same time or you risk causing the certificate generation to fail. For best results you'll want to trigger the recording with one action (an onblur or onfocus of an element, clicking a button, etc) and then trigger the submission of the form with a separate action.

# What is a masked TrustedForm certificate?

Creating and using masked TrustedForm certificates

The TrustedForm retaining process creates a certificate that can be used with the lead data to document the consumer session without exposing the web site where the consumer filled in a form. This documents the lead for the lead buyer.

A masked certificate:

- is a copy of a normal TrustedForm certificate that conceals a lead's originating web site
- is created during the retain process by default, **EXCEPT** **for TrustedForm certificates generated by Facebook Lead Ads**
- is a valid TrustedForm certificate with its own 69-character certificate URL, like the originally retained certificate.
- does not display the page URL of the web site on which the lead was created
- does not show the Session Replay or Event Log
- can be retained as normal, and will be retained in your account. See [more information about retaining a masked certificate](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4887952-why-can-t-i-retain-a-masked-certificate) for more discussion.
- can be used with the Insights product to request the same properties available to an unmasked certificate. However, the domain property will report as masked version of the domain that correlates to actual domain so that it suitable to use for lead filtering without exposing the source.

#### How lead vendors use the masked certificate

Resellers of leads sometimes use masked certificates with the lead data to document the consumer session without exposing the web site where the consumer filled in a form.

#### Cautions for lead buyers

The masked certificate provides much consumer information to describe the consumer session, such as IP address, location, etc., and ensures the buyer that there is a documented lead being presented by the seller. However, in case of a consumer complaint, the Lead Buyer may need to have access to the full certificate, which includes the page location of the form and the consumer session playback. For this reason, the use of a masked certificate requires a level of relationship with the lead vendor from which it is received. The lead vendor providing masked certificates must retain the certificates and maintain their TrustedForm account for several years in order to service requests for the full certificate. Please [see our community page](https://community.activeprospect.com/) for more information.

#### How to generate a masked certificate using the certificate API

To generate a masked certificate from a full TrustedForm Certificate, follow these steps:

1. Retain the TrustedForm certificate for the lead using the [instructions on our developer site](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Retain/) or in [this community article](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4885100-how-to-claim-an-individual-trustedform-certificate).
2. Capture the response from the retain process, which will include the masked\_cert\_url. Here is an example.     ""masked\_cert\_url"": "" [https://cert.trustedform.com/1145b610ac97aa9f92d7cd2195446eac5e67ce53](https://example.com/1145b610ac97aa9f92d7cd2195446eac5e67ce53)""
3.  Once you have the masked certificate that corresponds to your lead, you can pass this value to your customer as the lead's TrustedForm certificate.

# Deploying the TrustedForm Certify Web SDK Using Google Tag Manager

Use Google Tag Manager to simplify deploying TrustedForm across multiple web pages

Google Tag Manager (GTM) can be used to be used to manage tags/scripts deployed on your websites in a central location without changing their source code. Users often use this to simplify implementation of TrustedForm Certify across multiple web pages but doing so comes with risk. GTM may be blocked for a number of reasons including:

- Ad blockers: Ad blockers can block GTM by default or manually.
- Browser settings: Some browsers, like the latest version of Opera, block GTM completely.
- Safari Incognito Mode or Advanced Tracking protection: These settings block GTM and other scripts.
- Exception triggers and additional consent checks: These are common causes of blocked tags.


Reports indicate that as much as 5% of traffic blocks GTM which. If TrustedForm Certify is implement using GTM this would prevent it from creating certificates for that traffic. As such, **ActiveProspect recommends adding the the Web SDK directly into source code of your websites rather than using GTM**. If you still would like to use GTM follow the instructions below.

# How It Works

First, be sure your container is configured for your domain and its scripts are installed in the source code of your site's form pages:

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/463/801/original.png?f=1610650552&Expires=1748567794&Signature=IAUKLuHMo~w~gZxbu-J-URcH41j~J13POZ3lKZGOAfY9bbjnMB-tWyHTyV~C8IloRiayyNyCuGi6f9W3DLBDHSrq6yIRwYcp2k5am-qlXYCPijJoGOCVuoxPve9pNg380hkz9LFxar9~K0dd7VWzm9i1sK49UfOPlvJ7YArX2p-RAdJwWba1eBF5qnl-XlFyaIp27VYwRbSNlkjkTWmYYWy5Vn7M28~qQTMGTj5ba~WE4eeIw30my7elWRtD1~I-MKYCOj5smIhZOK1d6KEB-HbTSAjAc-IYR1phpEuFB50omTRJLpoHWOofPcjhSfp9-ZhRpotndckdM-BYDs-bbA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Next, create a custom HTML tag named ""TrustedForm"" and place the TrustedForm Certify Web SDK's Javascript Snippet into it. Set the trigger to ""DOM Ready"":

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/463/805/original.png?f=1610650661&Expires=1748567794&Signature=in3vyMRMcdyBo1SOM3i4ypja5iN0I3mVTo7dDSKxzvvjtHSYVBN~oTpR8QN2uWDKXizpy4Yj8oSwODzW9KLBC23KNEVef0KofbuQvAOHiHiAHSEHMGEdUXvsaDeBTWARs1jUblBkv~zIvYlHAGp~XJ9mfxcq2E78p4qZp6kbIvOgwfxNKf72R0yamZ4LrpbQbLV8KRPnOjcs6uhBtCmnNfYEtTQS0-3ycQtN4LWdnWi6Xz2kTwa4KX5Y15HRySLeEBfJ8jvZbKejdjetpdVaRr5Ixi1vrr-kswItxRjm4vlWpg-Wb3g02mynFRNg2XDWPKL3QQdaH6ZOjMkQY548Og__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Publish the container and Google Tag Manager will handle the rest.

To check that the TrustedForm Web SDK is firing properly, use your browser's inspect feature (right-click on the page and select ""Inspect"" from the menu.) to view the in-memory page source. If the script is loading and executing, you'll see the TrustedForm hidden fields  in the form code, populated with a TrustedForm Certificate URL. The Certificate URL will be different every time the page is loaded:

# What can I do if my TrustedForm Certificate does not capture a Submit event and my certificates are not extended?

Simple measures to increase the percentage of extended certificates

A TrustedForm Certificate's claim window will be extended (following a short delay after creation) to 90 days if the TrustedForm servers successfully receive an event showing that the visitor to the lead generation page has pressed Submit. To maximize the percentage of extended certificates:

1\. Check for a Submit event on the Event Log tab of several certificates from your web site.

2\. If the Submit event is never present on the Event Log of certificates generated on the web site:

- In order to be detected by TrustedForm, a Submit button must be within a standard <form> tag on the page; check our [community article](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4488105-extended-claim-window-for-submitted-leads) for more details
- The visitor to the site must click the button in order to submit the lead (and/or advance to a new page)


3\. If the Submit event is sometimes, but not always, present on the Event Log tabs:

- In some cases, the user’s submit event may not have time to be sent before the page changes or the TrustedForm script stops recording the page. If you see a Submit event on on the Event Log intermittently,  it may be helpful to introduce a slight delay before advancing to a new page or ending the TrustedForm recording

# Manually Stopping TrustedForm Certify Web SDK recording

The default behavior of the TrustedForm script is to load up, scan the page, and begin recording end-user interactions until the page is unloaded, typically because the form is submitted and the end-user is redirected to a Thank You Page.

However, with the proliferation of Single Page Applications (SPA) a web form submission does not necessarily unload the page. The TrustedForm script supports this use case with a built-in global function

**Manual Stop**

Once the TrustedForm script is loaded and is recording the global function

```
trustedFormStopRecording()
```

can be invoked to stop TrustedForm.

**PLEASE NOTE**: Once the stop recording function is called, the recording cannot be restarted.

# Form Whitelist

The default behavior of the TrustedForm script is to inject a hidden field containing the value of the TrustedForm Certificate URL into every form on the page.

However, it's possible to create a whitelist of one or more forms to inject the hidden field into, with only a couple of minor modifications to the script.

1. Add a new variable named formId
2. Add a new parameter and value (see below) to the line beginning with '://api.trustedform.com.

```
<script type=""text/javascript"">
 (function() {
...
 var formId = 'hello';
...
 '://api.trustedform.com/trustedform.js?form_selector='+escape(formId);
...
</script>
```

The value provided to the variable **formId** can be a form name, class, or ID applied to a form using the following patterns:

```
<form name=""hello"">
var formId = 'hello';

<form class=""howdy"">
var formId = '.howdy';

<form id=""bonjour"">
var formId = '#bonjour';
```

Multiple forms can also be targeted by providing a comma-delimited list of targets.

```
<form name=""hello"">
<form class=""howdy"">
<form id=""bonjour"">
var formId = 'hello,.howdy,#bonjour';
```

**FYI**: If no targeted forms can be located, the hidden field will not be injected into any form. It is the responsibility of the form owner to maintain the accuracy of the form target.

# How are failures handled with LeadConduit's TrustedForm Add-on step?

TrustedForm Certified Leads were designed to be accessed via API so that the Certificate of Authenticity data can be appended to the lead data. In other words, it was designed to integrate with your lead management system. If you are using [LeadConduit](http://activeprospect.com/products/leadconduit/) to process your Internet leads, it is very simple to append the Certificate data.

When a Certified Lead is submitted to LeadConduit, LeadConduit automatically captures the Certificate URL with the lead. If your flow includes a TrustedForm add-on step, LeadConduit also contacts the TrustedForm API in order to verify the authenticity of the certificate and append the Certificate data to the lead record.

The TrustedForm add-on integration step will result in failure if:

- The certificate URL that you receive is invalid or
- The certificate's Retain Window has expired

If you would like to halt delivery to other destinations, you should configure the ""delivery failure"" event to stop delivering the lead.

# TrustedForm Verify

Verify is a TrustedForm product offering that allows you to assess if a consumer gave their express written consent to be contacted when purchasing 3rd party leads. You can set rules that enable you to determine whether lead events meet the requirements set by your legal and/or compliance teams to keep your business safe and ensure the consumers you contact wanted you to reach out. By making a simple API call you will be able to verify the following:

- You have approved the consent language presented during the lead event
- The consumer specifically and explicitly consented to hear from your company
- The consent language was presented in a clear and conspicuous manner

# How It Works

Ask your lead vendors to implement [TrustedForm Certify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/certify) and send a TrustedForm Certificate URL along with the leads you purchase from them. Then use our [Certificate API](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Certificate-URL/) to make a request to verify your lead and send the results to the system you use to make purchasing decisions.The API response will inform you if the certificate meets the requirements you have set. If not, you may want to immediately reject the lead, flag it for a manual review, or use non-regulated contact methods. If your requirements are met make sure to retain the certificate so that you have proof of the consent you have verified and you can confidently purchase the lead and contact the consumer

Verify makes the following checks available to enforce the requirements you have set for your leads:

- [Approved Language Check](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474009-trustedform-verify-approved-language-check)
- [Font Size Check](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5561944-trustedform-verify-font-size-check)
- [Contrast Ratio Check](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5561943-trustedform-verify-contrast-ratio-check)
- [Opt-in Type Check](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5619028-trustedform-verify-opt-in-type-check)
- [1:1 Consent Check](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5471724-trustedform-verify-1-1-consent-check)

# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **How do I get access to TrustedForm Verify?**

New customers should contact [sales@activeprospect.com](mailto:sales@activeprospect.com). Contracted customers must contact their account manager for purchase. Self-service customers must enable it in the [Features hub](https://account.activeprospect.com/features).

2. **Will this allow me to view and retain TrustedForm certificates?**

No, in order to view TrustedForm certificates you must use TrustedForm Retain to get view access and retain certificates in your account.

3. **How should I communicate the requirements I have set in Verify to my lead vendors?**

TrustedForm Verify can be used to enforce requirements and check them in an automated fashion. However, communication of these to your vendor must still be handled independently of TrustedForm. We recommend you document your requirements, send them to your vendors and get confirmation that they have made any necessary changes before you begin rejecting leads that fail your acceptance criteria.

4. **How do I use the API?**

Verify is available as part of the TrustedForm Certificate API once your account has been given access to it. You must have a development team that is able to build a custom solution using the [verify operation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Verify/) or a lead distribution software that has integrated with TrustedForm Verify. If your current software does not support this reach out to their team to request it or consider using [ActiveProspect's LeadConduit](https://activeprospect.com/leadconduit/) which stays up to date with all of TrustedForm's newest features and product offerings.

5. **Can Verify be used with masked certificates?**

Yes. Masked certificates obscure the source from which they were generated. Verify does not inherently reveal any information directly about the source so it can be used with a masked certificate. If information about the source of a website is revealed in it's consent language then it is the publisher's responsibility to make any necessary edits to their consent language to prevent this in the future.

6. **What are the possible Verify failures?** Visit the [documentation here](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5415514-trustedform-possible-failure-outcomes-on-api-v4-0) to learn about the possible failure outcomes under Verify.

7. **Can I test Verify without rejecting leads?**

Yes, Verify itself doesn't cause your leads to be rejected. It returns a determination of whether or not they met specified criteria. Generally a lead distribution system such as LeadConduit will manages lead rejection. This means to test Verify without rejecting your leads you should set up a process that will make a Verify request to get the information and report on it but not act on it until you are ready.

8. **Is there a way to set up different criteria for different sources, locations or types of leads?**

TrustedForm Verify does not have this capability directly, but this possible using LeadConduit. LeadConduit gives users the flexibility to build flows with steps that only run under certain conditions. By taking advantage of this you can customize your Verify request using any of the data available with your lead.

# TrustedForm Retain

Retain is a TrustedForm product that allows you to view and store TrustedForm certificates that can be used to prove what took place during a lead event. Use this to perform manual audits of lead generation or as evidence during lawsuits. Make sure your certificates show [prior express written consent](https://activeprospect.com/blog/tcpa-consent/) was obtained properly. If not, demand that your suppliers change their practices and only provide leads with certificates that do. All you need is a TrustedForm Certificate URL to make a simple API call that will retain the certificate in your account. If you are generating certificates you also have the option to use the [Auto-Retain](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4812756-trustedform-auto-retain-for-first-party-lead-certification) feature and make the process even easier. Use TrustedForm Retain to do the following:

- Prove how leads were created

- Audit lead generation practices

- Visually see a recreation of lead events

- And more!


**How it Works**

Ask your lead vendors to use [TrustedForm Certify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/certify/) and send a TrustedForm Certificate URL along with the lead. Then immediately use the [TrustedForm Certificate API](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Certificate-URL/) to make a request for the certificate to be retained in your account. This requires that you provide the email and/or phone number of the lead associated with the certificate in order to perform [lead matching](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4766190-trustedform-lead-matching) in attempt to make sure that the two belong together. Make sure to store the Certificate URL in your CRM or wherever your lead data is stored so that you can retrieve the correct certificate for any lead later on. Once retained, you can access that certificate from it's URL for 5 years.

# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **How do I get access to TrustedForm Retain?**

If you are a managed customer contact your account administrator or sales@activepropsect.com for purchase. If not TrustedForm Retain will be available to by signing up for a self service plan with ActiveProspect.

2. **Will this allow me to view and retain TrustedForm certificates?**

Yes, by default certificates are retained in your account for 5 years. During that time you will be able to view them at will. Once that time period pass the certificate will be deleted and unable to be recovered. If you would like to modify the amount of time certificates are retained in your account you must be a  managed customers and reach out to your account administrator.

3. **How long am I able to use TrustedForm Retain to store a TrustedForm certificate?**

Until the TrustedForm certificate's retention period expires. For most certificate this will be 90 days from its creation, however if we are unable to confirm that a consumer expressly submitted their information to become a lead the certificate will be deleted in only 3 days. Once you have used Retain to store a certificate, your copy will be available for as long as your account's storage period is configured to last. By default this is 5 years but can be extended or shortened upon request.

4. **If I have multiple TrustedForm products how do I use Retain in isolation?**

Visit the API documentation for details on how to only perform each operation available in the latest version of the API.  Only pass the parameters listed in the Retain section to avoid using other products.

5. **How can I retain certificates in bulk?**

Bulk operations are not supported. Certificates must be retained individually.

6. **How long do I have to wait to view certificates that I have retained?**

Certificates that you have retained or viewed recently are generally available immediately. If the certificate has been moved to long term storage it will take 3-5 hours for it retrieved and made available to view.

7. **Why 5 years and can I change how long I'll have access?**

By default we choose to store 5 years to ensure it is available for the full time period establish by the statue of limitation set by the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), the most common use case for storing TrustedForm certificates. If you have another use case that requires a different time period and are a managed customer you can reach out to your account administrator to explore other options.

# TrustedForm Verify 1:1 Consent Check

The FCC has implemented a [new rule requiring consumers to give explicit consent to be contacted by each advertiser individually](https://activeprospect.com/blog/fcc-one-to-one-consent?_gl=1*pv3zqv*_gcl_au*MzUyMDY1NzE1LjE3MjI4Nzc1NjY.*_ga*OTA3MjA4OTIuMTY5OTQxNDgwMg..*_ga_QHXBV6N7D1*MTcyNjE5NDA5Ny4xMjUxLjAuMTcyNjE5NDA5Ny42MC4wLjA.) when using regulated technology commonly referred to as the one-to-one consent requirement. This presents a challenge because it is difficult to tell if your purchased leads satisfy this requirement without a lot of manual review. TrustedForm Verify's 1:1 Consent Check is a new feature that enables you to programmatically verify that each lead has given one-to-one consent to be contacted by your company and does the hard work for you. Integrate this with your automated lead processes to stop noncompliant leads from making it into your funnel with as little manual work as possible. This will help stay compliant if you use it to check each lead and do one or more of the following:

- Check for one-to-one consent before purchasing a lead and avoid the ones that don't have it
- Flag the leads you purchase that haven't given your company one-to-one consent and avoid using regulated technology to contact them
- Maximize your risk mitigation by only contacting leads that pass this check and have given you one-to-one consent

# Quick Start Guide For Advertisers

1. Request that your vendors enable this feature by following [TrustedForm's Consent Tagging instructions](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/consent-tagging).
2. Determine what should happen when a lead has not given consent in a one-to-one manner.
3. Relay this to your developer and ask them to use the ""one\_to\_one"" property shown in the [API documentation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Verify) **OR** ask your lead distribution software provider how you can use this feature.

# How It Works

Ask your lead vendors to use [TrustedForm Certify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/certify/), then [add our new consent tags](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/consent-tagging) (not compatible with sources such as Meta Leads Ads, mobile applications and certain form builders) to their forms and send a TrustedForm Certificate URL along with the lead. You should provide them with the exact text you would like them to use when requesting consent for your company (i.e. your company's legal name). Next enable the 1:1 Consent Verification Check on your [verification criteria page](https://app.trustedform.com/verification_criteria?__hstc=41051389.0d161cfe7cd4b672e23cb3185301a089.1748564203543.1748564203543.1748564203543.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564203544&__hsfp=3707738794) , enter your Company's legal name then click Save.

Next use the [Certificate API](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Certificate-URL/) and make a [Verify request](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Verify/) which will run all of the checks you have enabled **on the verification criteria page (note you can also modify your requirements per query**[using query parameters](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Verify/)). Send the results to the system you use to make purchasing decisions or your CRM depending on where you want to use this data. If you don't have a system that is able to integrate with this feature, consider purchasing [LeadConduit](https://activeprospect.com/leadconduit).

The results include a ""one\_to\_one"" property which will be one of the following values:

- **true** \- you have been given one-to-one consent
- **false** \- you were not given one-to-one consent
- **null** \- your vendor has not [added the required consent tags](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/consent-tagging) or you didn't include your company's name in the request. It also applies to certificates from Meta Lead Ads or native mobile apps, where this check can't be performed.

If you only want to check for one-to-one consent, use the value of the ""one\_to\_one"" property to determine how you would like process the lead. If you would also like to use the [approved language check](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474009-trustedform-verify-approved-language-check) then use the ""success"" property which combines both.

# Frequently Asked Questions

01. **Does the 1:1 Consent Check allow select-all buttons and preselected checkboxes?**

    Yes, legal experts have found these practices to be acceptable as long as it is reasonably clear that the consumer has the ability to make individual selections
02. **Does using the 1:1 Consent Check satisfy all of the FCC’s  consent requirements?**

    No, complying with all of the requirements requires a broad strategy that should be discussed with your compliance/legal teams. However, using the 1:1 Consent Check is essential to comply with the most noteworthy of the changes made.
03. **Can the 1:1 Consent Check be used on all my leads?**

    This depends on whether or not your lead generators have made the necessary changes to enable this feature. If not, reach out to your vendors to request the changes be made. ActiveProspect’s team is dedicated to helping them update their processes accordingly.
04. **Can the 1:1 Consent Check tell if checkboxes used to select advertisers were pre-selected for the consumer on the form?**

    No, the FCC has not provided clarity on whether or not the pre-selection of checkboxes affects giving consent in a one to one manner. Therefore this feature doesn’t use that data when making a determination. As the FCC and relevant case law provide more clarification this will be updated if needed.
05. **Can the 1:1 Consent Check work if logos/images are used instead to allow the consumer to select which advertisers they would like to hear from?**

    Yes. If logos are used in place of text, the publisher must create their form in [such a way that selecting a logo also selects a checkbox and text based name of the advertiser behind the scenes](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474057-how-do-i-add-trustedform-consent-tags-when-using-logos-images-instead-of-text-t) as specified in the consent tagging instructions.
06. **Can the 1:1 Consent Check work if tiles are used instead to allow the consumer to select which advertisers they would like to hear from?**

    Yes. If tiles are used in place of checkboxes, the publisher must create their form in [such a way that selecting a tile also selects a checkbox and text based name of the advertiser behind the scenes](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474059-how-do-i-add-trustedform-consent-tags-when-using-tiles-instead-of-checkboxes-to) as specified in the consent tagging instructions.
07. **Does the 1:1 Consent Check include font size and contrast detection?**

    No, the 1:1 Consent Check is focused on making sure that consent was given in a one to one manner. The Verify product will add more checks focused on other compliance needs such as ensuring consent language is clear and conspicuous.
08. **Does it work on the ping or post?**

    It works as long as the consumer giving their consent has been recorded. However, most vendors will ping before this happens meaning we expect this to be use primarily on the post.
09. **How does it / can it respond to the results?  Alert? Message? Etc?**

    Using the certificate API you could set up alerts, messages or anything your technical team is able to provide.
10. **Do you plan to support other lead routing systems?**

    We’re in the process of requesting this of popular systems but it depends on whether or not the decide to support it. We’re happy to work with any system to advise them on how to make this feature available in their platform. Reach out to your providers and make a feature request.
11. **How many tags are required?**

    At least 4, but this varies based on how your form is structured. For more information, please refer to [TrustedForm's Consent Tagging instructions](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/consent-tagging).
12. **Any comment about ease to implement?  How long does it take to set up?**

    Setup is very simple for both the publisher and buyer setup. Average setup time is 1-2 hours.
13. **What about some publisher pages who lack knowledge for coding tagging?  (Some out the box drag drop no customization site creation services)?  What level of technical knowledge is needed to implement on webpage?**

    Adding consent tags requires a very basic understanding of HTML. However, even someone with no technical knowledge could look at the examples, copy and paste using our example as a guide. If you have any trouble our support team is ready to help and as we collect more feedback we’ll create custom guides for using specific form builder / landing page providers.
14. **Is there case sensitivity in fields like advertiser name?**

    When checking for the appropriate advertiser name we do some common sense normalization including ignore case and redundant whitespaces.
15. **Do I need a new contract for this service?**

    Our Verify product offering is available to self service accounts. So you can start using it without a contract.
16. **Do I need an account?**

    Yes, an account is required to use any TrustedForm product offering or feature.
17. **What are the possible reasons for 1:1 Consent Check failure?**

      For information on the possible reasons for one-to-one consent failure, please refer to [Verify Product Errors](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5549054-verify-product-errors-on-api-v4-0).

# Does page scan work for TrustedForm Facebook Lead Ads certificates?

Yes. However, TrustedForm Facebook Lead Ads certificates only supports page scan of the [custom disclaimer text](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1550411888622740) and checkbox questions. This means it will not search for text on the entire page but only in the supported areas.

# How to retain an individual TrustedForm certificate

As part of your lead management process, you will want to automate the retention of TrustedForm certificates via the TrustedForm API or via ActiveProspect's LeadConduit product. But every once in awhile, or as you're preparing your automated process, you may need to retain a certificate manually.

## The quick method to retain: Click ""Retain Certificate""

By far the easiest method to retain the certificate for future viewing is to

- Display the certificate in your browser, and
- Click ""Retain Certificate,"" the green button displayed prominently on the certificate.

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/287/028/original.png?f=1714593333&Expires=1748567803&Signature=iDOZQPxyloPc1MPV1bIUtoqihVuB9w8JQWgYkbV2XIiPX29CAfRWPPEV3mGVlL9sEOroI2HYZ0uCyp9MxLoGtghPLUxMW~i~-Uv5tH2PZ6B-Gr0d8pzr6tK0CSH9UzG0OHiw6NO0Xgj~avNoUoHBZac7sMbE9NdRtBSYRNyE1~VrL8ETG~on7voS-ddlc8LyIjILkTD058NZCf8pAniwUpJH5VSJDU-6fnEdeztpJMACqei-7Z6Yvj1Iif3Nk-OCReEztJA33AiJ8DWjQ5ZWK~92meqvEbCoWxGJR6JkrO9kcm5Zc--i~ilzQBmeCrZU8sysGIVwBWoz4jrkHnROqw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

## Manually Retain and Perform Lead Matching

You might want to perform lead matching to make sure you confirm the email and phone that should be retained in the certificate. In order to do this, retain the certificate via one of the following methods.

To retain a certificate manually, in both of the examples given below, substitute your API key from the TrustedForm Settings instead of ""9e46a3b3c2456f33bec5ec51b7cb68"", the TrustedForm Certificate URL instead of ""[https://cert.trustedform.com/b3220852042971a00f5d05766254e6b0747e24dc](https://cert.trustedform.com/b3220852042971a00f5d05766254e6b0747e24dc?__hstc=41051389.ca004fe17407d98c67c1fb1d809a1916.1748564204628.1748564204628.1748564204628.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564204628&__hsfp=3707738794)"", the lead's phone number instead of ""5555555555"" and the lead's email instead of ""example@gmail.com"".

A. On MacOS X:

1. Open the ""terminal"" app.

2. At the command line, substituting for the API key and TrustedForm Certificate URL, enter this and press Enter:


/usr/bin/curl-XPOST-H'Content-type:application/json'-H 'Accept: application/json' \

-u'API:9e46a3b3c2456f33bec5ec51b7cb68' -H 'api-version: 4.0' \

--data '{""retain"":{}, ""match\_lead"":{""phone"":""5555555555"", ""email"":""example@gmail.com""}}' \

https://cert.trustedform.com/b3220852042971a00f5d05766254e6b0747e24dc

Please note that the above request uses api-version of 4.0. If you have 3.0 (and please check your TrustedForm Settings to determine this) you will need to change the format slightly, making the same substitutions for email, phone, and the TrustedForm Certificate URL you want to retain:

/usr/bin/curl-XPOST-H'Content-type:application/json'-H 'Accept: application/json' \

-u'API:9e46a3b3c2456f33bec5ec51b7cb68' -H 'api-version: 3.0' \

--data '{""phone"":""5555555555"", ""email"":""example@gmail.com""}' \

https://cert.trustedform.com/b3220852042971a00f5d05766254e6b0747e24dc

B. You can use [Postman’](https://identity.getpostman.com/login)s web client on any browser and do the following:

1. After signing in, navigate to the “My Workspace” page.

2. Select the import button on the left side panel and import the Postman collection that matches your API version.
   - [Version 3.0 Collection](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1pk9ut9e8Y8l_c_UMpP7UxVAq-45iPFWk&export=download)

   - [Version 4.0 Collection](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1kaHFx1ZnSoKya_zqirzkepF8bG0kiqTK&export=download)
3. Expand “TrustedForm Certificate API” collection and select the “Retain Certificate” POST request below.

4. Enter the TrustedForm certificate URL into the labeled field next to POST.

5. Enter the lead's phone number and/or email in the labeled fields in the body section (if applicable).

6. Select the authorization tab, and enter your API key into the Password field.

7. Click the **Send** button to retain the certificate.

# Why can't I retain a Masked Certificate?

A masked certificate is just like any other TrustedForm certificate in many ways. The format of the Certificate URL is the same and the certificate is proof of a session giving the location and much other information about the consumer who filled out the web form. A masked certificate is like any certificate, except: the masked certificate doesn't list the Page URL for the form and excludes the session replay showing the consumer session.

If you can't retain a masked certificate, it's likely to be because of these two factors:

#### A. Short Retain Window

Masked TrustedForm Certificates have a 72 hour retain window. They cannot be extended. This means that they must be retained within 72 hours of their creation.

B. Your retain always has outcome ""failure"" with the reason ""None of the provided fingerprints match""

This message is a cautionary message because the web session html is missing in a masked certificate, and it is impossible to check that the email and phone  in a masked certificate matches the lead information.

#### Check whether you should be able to retain the Masked certificate:

1\. Bring up the full Certificate URL, beginning with [https://cert.trustedform.com](https://cert.trustedform.com/), in your browser.

2\. If the certificate can be retain, the page will show a banner giving the retain window, as in the below example.

# TrustedForm Page Scan

TrustedForm can perform a real-time scan of lead generation forms to identify whether or not text specified by a user is present. The page scan works by searching the form's text that has been stored in a TrustedForm certificate. When you make a request to the TrustedForm service you are able to input the text snippet you would like to search for. The output will then include each supplied snippet and whether or not it was found. This can be used to ensure that leads were shown required text like disclosure languages, terms of service or intended data use are present or to filter out leads that were incentivized by free offers, part of deals with undesirable partners or unaware that you intend to contact them. As a best practice, when configuring page scan we highly recommend storing your text snippets in a single document that you can copy and paste from to avoid typing mistakes to have an easy to access record of the text you are scanning for.

**PLEASE NOTE:** TrustedForm Facebook Lead Ads certificates only supports page scan of the [custom disclaimer text](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1550411888622740?id=735435806665862) and checkbox questions.

# Page Scan using TrustedForm API

[Required scan terms](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v3.0/tag/Claiming-Certificates/#tag/Claiming-Certificates/operation/ClaimerWeb.ClaimController.create!path=required_scan_terms&t=request) or [forbidden scan terms](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v3.0/tag/Claiming-Certificates/#tag/Claiming-Certificates/operation/ClaimerWeb.ClaimController.create!path=forbidden_scan_terms&t=request) must be provided as parameters when the API request is made in order to use this feature. After this the results of which were found and not found will be returned in the API response. Visit [developers.activeprospect.com](https://developers.activeprospect.com/) for more information.

# Page Scan using LeadConduit

You can set required and/or forbidden text in the TrustedForm step in LeadConduit, to add TrustedForm step to your flow, follow the steps [here](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5098468-trustedform-leadconduit-add-on?_gl=1*ahjo2d*_gcl_au*MTI1NTg1MTA5NS4xNzM2NzgxNDA4LjE2Mjg3NTExMjQuMTczNzc0OTExOC4xNzM3NzQ5MTE4*_ga*NTQ3NjI0NDQxLjE3MzQ2Mzk3NDQ.*_ga_QHXBV6N7D1*MTczODAxNjEzMy4xNTIuMS4xNzM4MDE2NzUyLjM5LjAuMA..).

If you selects Insights, chose **Page Scan** data point to be appended to your flow. Once that is selected,  you'll be prompted to specify the Required and Forbidden texts in the subsequent configuration step.

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/786/623/original.png?f=1738017711&Expires=1748567802&Signature=Rf~daUD7nk7Zx7kl6GE9g5mogNUUt2ZdfQHZEEa4g2SvoOTn8XoU1DJD-CPJofVbuO0DPPveS8GiqICN9NLIHab~Eq05dSURVi7pkd26niwo8LcbbmbdhS-2bgY7MrtyX3~WwvvWC-~JTNwKy3VqUFAg66R8ldSSH4Unazvjkq7JlmywJjwmHDsIdnRCgmwNYMrUHVCNLsAsnFWqbBLK6hNd988sP-nMX-8rS~bdgfpTFzTrnywVyKd3fmBRbZcW3l88XkGG4FqTMhHFHZ~tLIR0QRE2SF8OO9Ex66zgEfRJCwZ5kds8Q~OCoV0yF0iKjoYEnaDRMn8wxwMXpOZ39Q__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

You can specify them here, or do it later via the Edit Field Mappings button (you can add new or edit existing field mapping settings and define what you want to require or forbid), like shown below:

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/786/592/original.png?f=1738017288&Expires=1748567802&Signature=p7FYt7rNOPPHrAsxonORr-OypXfXOLsxqP2RaHPwlc~6OF0qTZtuC7HdIYFXS-fVv6l-G1LDZvbXvoXSogu7ATIs5XKjE-oHddNbhPtL-S98PwwkXFHlYXtFkTy~NCZvZZUphHjSd37Q8dLFM2QOEqMvsPxhQSrTUUBIwQ6muTq183xsQfMlqle3F9PUtnIekM4XcoHdI-N4M2cUhL9~XMV9jOstizSc8Q27MqJpna4H0FUnk3gmVwlXbgD~zEZxrCL-kjgwCwdyBQlr42YWJ5HaeYiZhqFGVrCJKx4Gmjw7bg7iRmrPYuZotN5fUFLB7fHMvynZg5JgrZvJrgdEfQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

In the example screenshot below, the required text is **solar** and **offer** and the forbidden text is **free**.

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/786/642/original.png?f=1738018422&Expires=1748567802&Signature=YH6uc3SzeeyM9k0LcNfR3EB-K3HIyyw7auywk34ErUD-JzPHv16HmesnkYx6Etx5n-Aylq-YKqPjCgy0spaWmpitAcQ-YRRIXbb6GgUgs2HU3JutlrUItK9bD4FssDZoaMI46ljJLEmczn95GUEzbYST0gsTGF1EqBnfVsDglPYhBmzb1SN4Ibdw3OXq699wDi85aFzbMHO05ydU0yonVgZnBsFFHaCHo~D~HpmOd9wsTiX9QMuAo~RfKPfETHUoagS0mylDHU5WOYVFATiiTFt121s8mYJ5t6J3vpZpMCbyFvlKcKUF~K7VFhz5Gl6eTNlu1Xtr9bazwEsK5Qk~Wg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

If you set up a filter which uses the outcome of this step,  then you will fail all leads that were not generated from a page which contains **solar** AND **offer** but does not contain **free**.

If you would like to accept leads with **solar** OR **offer** (a.k.a. only fail leads when none of the required text is found) the filter must check that **Trustedform Amount Required Matched** is equal to none.

That filter looks like this:

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/786/682/original.png?f=1738019321&Expires=1748567802&Signature=hM7gBtiPRndFM5UYUTmHySAj-Wn3jB8y7EvoF8xbxKPLgWKDQhWulY7C5vMy5GCQx73HODcAuDQvzoDPBTPC5JCBlT9k51J~eByuD8uCOg~I8RBOy6~DHt~shMKYahVOpZhSnuyypyXa-WBctyXow7OI~XAsZh4RaPsEve5dj5fZ8z8Njbnzu9jUxMRSImnEZHlguczl3PypU54HrvICVv-kW-1fM35kn56H~HAagxIsmBn6d0rFPSo-rRN6uLYeBwuFCPauRKzFQVae0cPkKegBNtaBjEJE84Y5atRxySGg260~EA7HPfKdLNYorPN4IvFW2rdz9jt~Fq6WJUxqFQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

- Amount Required Matched: How many of the required strings were matched? (all, some, none)
- Amount Forbidden Matched: How many of the forbidden strings were scanned? (all, some, none)

**Example Scenarios**

**NOTE:** Required and Forbidden text ignores casing and multiple whitespaces, but the text must otherwise be an EXACT MATCH.

- **Scenario 1:** You configure the required text "" **Telemarketing** **CALLS**"" and the page has "" **Telemarketing** **calls**""
  - **Outcome:** **PASSES** the required text audit.

- **Scenario 2:** You configure the required text "" **Telemarketing** **CALLS**"" and the page has "" **Telemarketing** **calls**""
  - **Outcome:** **FAILS** the required text audit because there is a required white space between **Telemarketing** and **calls**

- **Scenario 3:** You require the text "" **prerecorded telemarketing calls.**"" and the page instead has "" **pre-recorded telemarketing calls!**""
  - **Outcome:** **FAILS** the required text audit because:

1. the hyphen in the text and
2. the exclamation mark instead of the period at the end of the text.

#### Basic Troubleshooting of a TrustedForm Certify Web SDK Installation.

**Check: Is the Web SDK installed in the web page?**

**How to check this:**

1. Open the form page in your browser.
2. Look at the page source code using your browser’s “view page source” tool or “inspect” tool.
3. The Web SDK's script tags should appear in the form page’s source code. It must be located between the opening “<body>” tag and the closing “</body>” tag. Ideally it will be placed just above the closing “</body>” tag.


**Solution:**

- Make sure that the Web SDK's javascript snippet is placed in the page source code that the web server supplies to users.

**Check: Did the Web SDK insert the hidden TrustedForm fields into the form at run time?**

**How to check this:**

- Open the form page in your browser. Look at the page source code using your browser’s “view page source” tool (not the “inspect” tool). There should not be any fields with names containing the value of the Web SDK’s “field” var in the form.
- Now look at the form code with your browser’s “inspect” tool (not the “view page source” tool).
- There should be three type=”hidden” fields in the form in the “Inspect” view. By default they will be named  named “xxTrustedFormToken”, “xxTrustedFormCertUrl”, and “xxTrustedFormPingUrl”. If the TrustedForm Web SDK has it’s “field” var set to something other than “xxTrustedFormCertUrl”, then the TrustedForm-inserted fields will be named according to the Web SDK’s ‘field” var’s value.
- The value of those hidden fields will be a string in the form of a URL that begins as [https://cert.trustedform.com/...](https://cert.trustedform.com/...?__hstc=41051389.1c8aee725c8d2b9f69f535127a7923a7.1748564205541.1748564205541.1748564205541.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564205541&__hsfp=3707738794) For xxTrustedFormToken and xxTrustedFormCertUrl.


**Solutions:**

- Make sure your browser does not have Javascript turned off.
- Ad Blockers may interfere with the Web SDK. Turn them off.
- Certain browsers, like “Brave” may block the Web SDK.
- Poor internet connection. The TrustedForm Certify Web SDK needs to be able to communicate with the TrustedForm service while the user is on the page.
- Make sure that the Web SDK's javascript snippet is located within the page’s “body> … </body>” tags.
- If the Web SDK's javascript snippet is wrapped in a function, make sure that function executes before the user performs any actions that you want to be captured.
- If the form is within an iframe, make sure that the Web SDK is installed within the page that contains the form, not the iframe’s parent page.

**Check: Are the values of the hidden TrustedForm fields being delivered in the form submit along with the other fields?**

**_How to check this using the Chrome browser:_**

1. Load the page and open your browser’s “inspect” too to its “Network” tab.
2. Fill out and submit the form.
3. Select the “submit” entry in the Inspect tool and scroll down to view the “Form Data” item.
4. You should see the form fields and the hidden TrustedForm fields, named as described above.


**Solutions:**

If you don’t see  fields, then one of the following may be the cause:

- Any of the reasons mentioned earlier in this article.
- You may be using a page creator or form generator application that does not capture fields that aren’t specifically created by that application. Consult your page or form builder’s support for information on how to capture and submit run-time-added hidden fields.

# Extended Retention Window for Submitted Leads

TLDR; By default certificates are only available to retained for 3 days. If a submission event is detected this gets extended to 90 days.

Once a certificate has been created, there is a limited window of time after which the certificate can no longer be retained. If you are planning to retain a certificate in long-term storage, you must do so before this retention window expires.

TrustedForm now extends the period a certificate is eligible to be retained if a submit event is detected on its lead generation form. By default certificates are only able to be retained for 3 days following their creation. This creates problems when you purchase aged leads / warm transfers as you often obtain the lead data after the retention period has ended. This means you miss out on having the opportunity to store the certificate and be protected. Extended certificates are able to be retained for 90 days which should give you more than enough time to retain relevant TrustedForm certificates. Prior to this change the only ways to extend a certificate required that you reach out to your lead vendor so they could implement the necessary steps to extend certificates. Now this happens automatically for leads that TrustedForm can validate were submitted!

## How it Works

TrustedForm Certify has been updated with new abilities that allow it to listen for events that explicitly indicate a form has been submitted or are associated with elements on a page that behave like a submit button. Certify is expected to accurately capture these submit events from any webpage using a standard <form> tag with a submit button embedded inside of it. Unfortunately, when publishers use less conventional means to submit lead data these events become more obscured and may not be caught. If a submission event is detected with high confidence, TrustedForm will automatically send this event and trigger the process to extend the certificate. We have observed that ~80% of certificates acknowledged to contain submitted leads are automatically extended. This process will take at least 15 minutes before it begins to ensure that all user activity is captured. Once it is complete you will see a longer time until the certificate is deleted if you visit the certificate URL before retaining it.

## Caveats

- Using the expiration of certificates as a means to avoid purchasing aged leads is no longer a reliable solution.

- The format of certain forms may prevent TrustedForm Certify from capturing submit event data.

- If a certificate does not get extended, that should not be considered a definitive indicator that the form wasn’t submitted.

- Certificate extension does not happen immediately after the lead submits their data which could lead to false assumptions that the certificate will not be extended.

- Certificates generated from Facebook Lead Ads always have a 12 week retention window.


## Frequently Asked Questions

- **How can I avoid reaching out to old leads that weren't generated recently?**

Check the lead age on TrustedForm certificates to determine if the lead was created recently.
- **How can I tell if Certify is detecting submit events for my certificates?**

View one a certificate for a lead from each of the forms you want to check. View the Event Log and search for ""submitted form"" event. If this event exists then it means a form submission was successfully captured.

Wait at least one hour after the certificate was generated before expecting to see an extended deletion date on the TrustedForm certificate UI. If the certificate has not been extended after this period have your vendor reach out to us so we can help them troubleshoot.

# How TrustedForm Certify Works

What happens when a consumer views a web page using TrustedForm Certify?

When a consumer visits a web page using a browser, the browser downloads a set of instructions on how to display the page to the consumer. Those instructions are called the Document Object Model, or DOM. The browser retains a copy of the DOM in the computer’s memory and uses it to create the visual elements on screen. The DOM may also instruct the browser to fetch additional files as needed (images, videos, sound, scripts and more).

Here’s the DOM of a simple form page using TrustedForm Certify:

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/870/620/original.png?f=1693503494&Expires=1748567805&Signature=Bja2WK2~q1xhIV-wB~9-ZnKknoIZZgxQmPt1JZuuB2FOjL-04KZGOESD5zVgaXhw4h0eO1vRUU~ZSk4TtdX0uOmeqWIrLnAnFn2hCniIsK8EXWkLkCPuVw8L5~OLOmIBd~l5yQSuVTM~TpshmMHB9gvmgp9itKctPNWGpfTpjKuud5BXis47asO93k0qFHaiFVcSX6LaoSAK-2LD1caJBBvbmso6zYAuudJUKA~~hhb-wJSVZwgR-Rw-r0Yf63~D4TE4957ryG~l9jnYeD~vB9v-4gCP2LGS061zaqRHghiSYgdxsG0H4Ut-s00OujWUKlPySgrJiJ-4B93v6-wLhw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

The TrustedForm Certify javascript snippet is part of the DOM, placed there by the web site’s developer. It executes once the page has loaded, first establishing a connection between the user’s browser and the TrustedForm service. Then begins a series of exchanges that occur in the background while the consumer has the page open:

- The browser sends to TrustedForm a copy of the DOM and details about the user’s computer environment (operating system, IP address, browser type and more).
- The TrustedForm service sends the script running in the browser a unique identifier string in the form of a URL. This is the TrustedForm certificate URL. The script modifies the in-memory DOM, adding hidden fields to the web forms in the page, and populating them with the TrustedForm certificate URL string, So now, the TrustedForm certificate URL fields become part of the data payload to be submitted to whatever server the form has as its target.

Here's our simple web page with the script-added TrustedForm fields:

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/460/623/original.png?f=1610549173&Expires=1748567805&Signature=fbAxppquyM4VQpkiMTRdLSqd1D7CjyAJBOKG9oLwpKat0iGFnnZ-6yTGozrOm8k0PaxV6RASqnTHltbhZtvbp-J0nGdM4e-EVgyz2ajeI3SD2IyKW8fYzyH92UzH7TZhfCAzFDQFASPn-0yxDUBkuPajvvBdBBeAg-A5VjBjma4KLh7abEs6LyDEyKLLVxgB-NxkYIPMv9DBuydWJJhuQU2rqb9LfPtCIJa2I-OXWAVnFA8PWxV49DCEwZCFVzIVEFY3-GNWO9--ClCQ~HiWogOlBUcVEaobOss8BaYnYM3I75kssZE3cp5qSg3G~zNu~YCsvuBqoPKHasdbIqqH2A__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

- As the consumer moves or clicks their cursor or presses keys, the browser sends a record of those events to TrustedForm.
- When the consumer either abandons the page or submits a form (which also causes page abandonment) the connection between the user’s browser and the TrustedForm service closes.
- At this point TrustedForm saves everything that the browser has sent up to it. This is the TrustedForm Certificate. It retrieves any additional files specified in the DOM from their respective servers and adds them to the Certificate, which is now complete.

TrustedForm will store the certificate for 72 hours. This period will be extended to 90 days if the consumer actively submitted a form indicating their intent to have their information saved. During that period, any one who makes a paid request to retain that certificate will have a copy of it stored in their account for 5 years (unless a different storage length is negotiated). They can then log into their TrustedForm account and visit the  TrustedForm certificate URL using their browser to view the certificate. The certificate displays the metadata about the visit / lead event and a recreation of it by replicating the user’s cursor and key events on top of a copy of the website as it appeared at that time (the “session replay”).

Here’s an example of a certificate created by our example form:

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/007/365/original.png?f=1639594297&Expires=1748567805&Signature=SBXSbN-5V5idjarZpxYTyr~WSB9ezMdwyiKdJysIKrQ-qbBEFnG5Uoy3NVPL5U8BdBqodwQyh3NVSt6-mph2-5poKiZ5FpVCU-7Uqh5ZW4RiFDuZA4oNsyPMGbyLYNeMQVGh~2-yRo5wCtieKhQFFJSPxubyFfU3~roqyVsmLdjX4xxRY9d0jkOiMxoguuZkNMfZEse4OCDCSmlueWBL4YpxBO2mBpI5FC1ysFrekcCD4Ou2LbIHLKWuU3zbFH~iGsblVib1e3~VuxzHqIY~ov0mIWv8TV6~3wLlUDQpyULGxRCkPGRh8EEnvnTp7ZRWPEjRD-PYZvxynh0dyc5BLg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

# Implementing TrustedForm on 123FormBuilders

How to add TrustedForm to a 123FormBuilders form.

Begin by logging into your FormBuilders account.

Select the form you want to use with TrustedForm by clicking edit or create a new form:

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/923/768/original.png?f=1697076499&Expires=1748567804&Signature=b68QIExp3wagKVOjkrYAyni2CBDbYzpJFKi8CUuP6XJh4bwwiVOWE30AGkszjt~wRtMyNYkti9X02cZ4D4cVzq3jL5kinDeAdTVUnre~bvBMHyZRAHrh~KENsyb08mkcMnLtr8wU67NjQ0GiKqteluOM2rAFagPBwbkNVh4Op8vSVh~g3tDhZTMMOhcj~f-aMgrDKgDllxetGpXbrJARXW6L~AtlcaQHxZFLFYALH015xwHqQTdG0ioZWIRo-D8TA2iAjcYN~b4DOZBTk03ltrxhlPiDudQCAIS06adxxgiiZxbGu~aB91S0~Ce2haTZBYv~xvIMtZIAQa37TNLqrQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Click on the 'Set up' tab:

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/923/769/original.png?f=1697076862&Expires=1748567804&Signature=QdTyn13KdpEwdwmM3Vv-TtN6AVKz~oHQHX3oyvmH6a4UObgwFvxZPpUgkOWsmCepy1pGJUBQj27S-44tTCwiBYFPqBej5IjGlf580InMJNhyAOJw7cP6B1qXicGT7Sl0cNGQmZoKSAxO~pVj6-M9DPT5gpkmNJw3~C2K6VFzcOv6i032iG4bFfqLTaBNxhqntQACdWzIw8q3YYSxSnRxjjzG55Sfn4di-7urb~3SL4T66r6K3V6exwvJHGAm2aF-78GomUAhSwuUACZSn2uOo1Hd3dwP7XH2YQ1CRnxYktiG~MmgKo80evVdUZ-PJm80eol1xID9cPZsOrPFrP1-8w__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Then click on 'Advanced' on the left side bar:

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/923/778/original.png?f=1697077120&Expires=1748567804&Signature=uE80c5ybEmm0qh36pm8VJDZD4vI43EucIjlR0QP9BzhfkfpLWPU-DTIIzVDZnG8IV7ejtm8qJnFiqUhHjOsH-A1efzv3beXXNWEE58ORgMF1dL9rlO4rvDZnu03yqV6XPHS7m8H~i7JCyMH~s0QbcRLHGNOrq6d~BblodTZMBOESxxdik4zCPxxCRQIyuGlzkQnlBozGe8-oSaSIFyPLzxEraaOV4SlpozIFj0ndUBfepBgQM~5AsL3raMFkrzFhmql6jX1pdFS0hVJc0wAOWZROB95Egiwj40RKH6dEK~cK2MkFxY5oHJPJ0p~Wyln0Kng3D9BfM2-m2V4yDa5gsA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Then click on the 'Form' tab. Then select 'Add a JS script to your form'.

Here we will be entering the URL of a .js file which holds the TrustedForm script.

To do that, first create a JS file that holds our TrustedForm script, then upload the JS file on a trusted web server or your own and use the URL where the file is located (e.g. https://mydomain.com/my-javascript.js). There are web services that host JavaScript files for you, but they represent certain risks, such as data corruption or service retirement. That’s the reason why it is best to host them on a web service where you have administrative access.

Once you have entered the URL of the JS file, click on 'Save', as follows:

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/923/784/original.png?f=1697077679&Expires=1748567804&Signature=QSTTXm7sbVsr3tRBdiRGRk0j424Ckzx03EdzT8HNZudmjF7u9a7fW54zRupB2iXQVD~8JoU8UusmC1a3aHqaUCFbRaydXhZWYT8~XyxLtEsWqfrq5EpnwaI5YyzJucPUpGdiRRj9sD-Z77AR-p8ieFrvQnJb4UlCLCQF-dvHp6t2AW8Aii8BqVOCvoXrVL3QUv2gA2zYzshg0Hzfl6ioWXlhxF6xIran0H61sYy8tpjIQ6iUvKNm9feotfzdlSvAo8uUq9KSmqkw94YnV018GWm9xK7~RTsd~nafZvDTC6CPT97B7z~9yFqMDixyP3fX-a-su1-OQh5pioc~tvAO4w__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

That's it! Now you should be able to publish and test the form, and the certificates should be created successfully.

# WordPress Form Generators and TrustedForm

There are probably a thousand WordPress form generators out there, with old ones disappearing and new ones appearing faster than anyone can keep track. Some of them deal with script-inserted fields gracefully, and some do not.

# Adding the TrustedForm Script to Your Form Page

Our customers have some success by placing the TrustedForm script either in the same place allotted in WordPress for Google's SEO tool, and also some success placing it using the WordPress Headers and Footers Scripts tool.

These screen shots illustrate where to find those options in your WordPress dashboard.

WordPress for Google's SEO tool:

# Don't Include a TrustedForm Field in Your Form

You should not, in general, create a TrustedForm hidden field in your form using your form generator. The TrustedForm script will add the necessary hidden field to the form in the user's browser memory at run time. Any same-named field already in place could interfere with that process.

# Checking Whether the Script Is Working

You can check a loaded form page for the presence of a populated hidden field named ""xxTrustedFormCertUrl\_0"" in the browser's page DOM by using the browser's ""inspect"" feature. (It will not be visible in the ""view page source"" feature because it exists only in memory, not in the source code.)

# Capturing and Submitting the TrustedForm Certificate URL field

There's still no guarantee that the field added by the TrustedForm script will be processed and submitted. That depends on how any scripts that are products of the form generator interact with the form.

# TrustedForm Verify 1:1 Consent Check

The FCC has implemented a [new rule requiring consumers to give explicit consent to be contacted by each advertiser individually](https://activeprospect.com/blog/fcc-one-to-one-consent?_gl=1*pv3zqv*_gcl_au*MzUyMDY1NzE1LjE3MjI4Nzc1NjY.*_ga*OTA3MjA4OTIuMTY5OTQxNDgwMg..*_ga_QHXBV6N7D1*MTcyNjE5NDA5Ny4xMjUxLjAuMTcyNjE5NDA5Ny42MC4wLjA.) when using regulated technology commonly referred to as the one-to-one consent requirement. This presents a challenge because it is difficult to tell if your purchased leads satisfy this requirement without a lot of manual review. TrustedForm Verify's 1:1 Consent Check is a new feature that enables you to programmatically verify that each lead has given one-to-one consent to be contacted by your company and does the hard work for you. Integrate this with your automated lead processes to stop noncompliant leads from making it into your funnel with as little manual work as possible. This will help stay compliant if you use it to check each lead and do one or more of the following:

- Check for one-to-one consent before purchasing a lead and avoid the ones that don't have it
- Flag the leads you purchase that haven't given your company one-to-one consent and avoid using regulated technology to contact them
- Maximize your risk mitigation by only contacting leads that pass this check and have given you one-to-one consent

# Quick Start Guide For Advertisers

1. Request that your vendors enable this feature by following [TrustedForm's Consent Tagging instructions](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/consent-tagging).
2. Determine what should happen when a lead has not given consent in a one-to-one manner.
3. Relay this to your developer and ask them to use the ""one\_to\_one"" property shown in the [API documentation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Verify) **OR** ask your lead distribution software provider how you can use this feature.

# How It Works

Ask your lead vendors to use [TrustedForm Certify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/certify/), then [add our new consent tags](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/consent-tagging) (not compatible with sources such as Meta Leads Ads, mobile applications and certain form builders) to their forms and send a TrustedForm Certificate URL along with the lead. You should provide them with the exact text you would like them to use when requesting consent for your company (i.e. your company's legal name). Next enable the 1:1 Consent Verification Check on your [verification criteria page](https://app.trustedform.com/verification_criteria?__hstc=41051389.2db3d0c5887daf7e87f4ef700ffafc17.1746726612251.1747793254981.1747799482041.36&__hssc=41051389.6.1747799482041&__hsfp=4052119064) , enter your Company's legal name then click Save.

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/972/455/original.png?f=1747758948&Expires=1748567811&Signature=STuY740~TkgHUJddUU8sdhbyTmXD0hAPRh76~RMKzNtQGSXSjKTanPLBCXscnxw2Z3NAI4Eo660qEpHQb6CXQgg3axRihzJWd4LhaqYF3b09a6lhdXGI9MkUPuF8ZniOVNReRxDahOSgq1tekeLtbNWXZ2XiPrm0L52jIQzGHjajVWpX7GQWBTwpRkTtS5R5dcpGsSDdZ1RbD7urWMQIcwht-5nVJ~xxRKXbK7XbLoDmVdAi6v-6HDUTMDFtdlKTJGinGoyCDJNWJ9oS91F-QH8pzf3FSQ6NeOH4LQdrxpy2Nh~fybAPpCGjHpAKnDCDHyjT73rJldc0EmUjF~dYOA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Next use the [Certificate API](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Certificate-URL/) and make a [Verify request](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Verify/) which will run all of the checks you have enabled **on the verification criteria page (note you can also modify your requirements per query**[using query parameters](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Verify/)). Send the results to the system you use to make purchasing decisions or your CRM depending on where you want to use this data. If you don't have a system that is able to integrate with this feature, consider purchasing [LeadConduit](https://activeprospect.com/leadconduit).

The results include a ""one\_to\_one"" property which will be one of the following values:

- **true** \- you have been given one-to-one consent
- **false** \- you were not given one-to-one consent
- **null** \- your vendor has not [added the required consent tags](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/consent-tagging) or you didn't include your company's name in the request. It also applies to certificates from Meta Lead Ads or native mobile apps, where this check can't be performed.

If you only want to check for one-to-one consent, use the value of the ""one\_to\_one"" property to determine how you would like process the lead. If you would also like to use the [approved language check](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474009-trustedform-verify-approved-language-check) then use the ""success"" property which combines both.

# Frequently Asked Questions

01. **Does the 1:1 Consent Check allow select-all buttons and preselected checkboxes?**

    Yes, legal experts have found these practices to be acceptable as long as it is reasonably clear that the consumer has the ability to make individual selections
02. **Does using the 1:1 Consent Check satisfy all of the FCC’s  consent requirements?**

    No, complying with all of the requirements requires a broad strategy that should be discussed with your compliance/legal teams. However, using the 1:1 Consent Check is essential to comply with the most noteworthy of the changes made.
03. **Can the 1:1 Consent Check be used on all my leads?**

    This depends on whether or not your lead generators have made the necessary changes to enable this feature. If not, reach out to your vendors to request the changes be made. ActiveProspect’s team is dedicated to helping them update their processes accordingly.
04. **Can the 1:1 Consent Check tell if checkboxes used to select advertisers were pre-selected for the consumer on the form?**

    No, the FCC has not provided clarity on whether or not the pre-selection of checkboxes affects giving consent in a one to one manner. Therefore this feature doesn’t use that data when making a determination. As the FCC and relevant case law provide more clarification this will be updated if needed.
05. **Can the 1:1 Consent Check work if logos/images are used instead to allow the consumer to select which advertisers they would like to hear from?**

    Yes. If logos are used in place of text, the publisher must create their form in [such a way that selecting a logo also selects a checkbox and text based name of the advertiser behind the scenes](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474057-how-do-i-add-trustedform-consent-tags-when-using-logos-images-instead-of-text-t) as specified in the consent tagging instructions.
06. **Can the 1:1 Consent Check work if tiles are used instead to allow the consumer to select which advertisers they would like to hear from?**

    Yes. If tiles are used in place of checkboxes, the publisher must create their form in [such a way that selecting a tile also selects a checkbox and text based name of the advertiser behind the scenes](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474059-how-do-i-add-trustedform-consent-tags-when-using-tiles-instead-of-checkboxes-to) as specified in the consent tagging instructions.
07. **Does the 1:1 Consent Check include font size and contrast detection?**

    No, the 1:1 Consent Check is focused on making sure that consent was given in a one to one manner. The Verify product will add more checks focused on other compliance needs such as ensuring consent language is clear and conspicuous.
08. **Does it work on the ping or post?**

    It works as long as the consumer giving their consent has been recorded. However, most vendors will ping before this happens meaning we expect this to be use primarily on the post.
09. **How does it / can it respond to the results?  Alert? Message? Etc?**

    Using the certificate API you could set up alerts, messages or anything your technical team is able to provide.
10. **Do you plan to support other lead routing systems?**

    We’re in the process of requesting this of popular systems but it depends on whether or not the decide to support it. We’re happy to work with any system to advise them on how to make this feature available in their platform. Reach out to your providers and make a feature request.
11. **How many tags are required?**

    At least 4, but this varies based on how your form is structured. For more information, please refer to [TrustedForm's Consent Tagging instructions](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/consent-tagging).
12. **Any comment about ease to implement?  How long does it take to set up?**

    Setup is very simple for both the publisher and buyer setup. Average setup time is 1-2 hours.
13. **What about some publisher pages who lack knowledge for coding tagging?  (Some out the box drag drop no customization site creation services)?  What level of technical knowledge is needed to implement on webpage?**

    Adding consent tags requires a very basic understanding of HTML. However, even someone with no technical knowledge could look at the examples, copy and paste using our example as a guide. If you have any trouble our support team is ready to help and as we collect more feedback we’ll create custom guides for using specific form builder / landing page providers.
14. **Is there case sensitivity in fields like advertiser name?**

    When checking for the appropriate advertiser name we do some common sense normalization including ignore case and redundant whitespaces.
15. **Do I need a new contract for this service?**

    Our Verify product offering is available to self service accounts. So you can start using it without a contract.
16. **Do I need an account?**

    Yes, an account is required to use any TrustedForm product offering or feature.
17. **What are the possible reasons for 1:1 Consent Check failure?**

      For information on the possible reasons for one-to-one consent failure, please refer to [Verify Product Errors](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5549054-verify-product-errors-on-api-v4-0).

# TrustedForm Verify Implementation Guide

[TrustedForm Verify](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4918830-trustedform-verify) should be used as part of every marketers process to ensure the leads they buy are compliant with regulations such as the TCPA. Follow this guide for a quick overview of what needs to be done to use it effectively.

# 1\. Make sure your vendors are passing properly tagged Certificates

To use any TrustedForm product offering, the first step is to make sure your leads come with a TrustedForm Certificate URL. Vendors are required to install [TrustedForm Certify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/certify?_gl=1*1a7we61*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3NDIyMzA3MzQuQ2owS0NRandrTi0tQmhEa0FSSXNBRF9tbklwSUViTEIwcDRvYkpLN0VIOTZtc3Q4d3NaSFJFVmktZEsxaE9odDFoNkd1aTRMV0pJYXZKMGFBZy1fRUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_au*MjExMTczODE4OC4xNzQ2NDU0Njc4LjU3ODUxOTg4LjE3NDcwNjkwMTguMTc0NzA2OTAyMA..*_ga*OTA3MjA4OTIuMTY5OTQxNDgwMg..*_ga_QHXBV6N7D1*czE3NDc3NTg2ODUkbzg5JGcxJHQxNzQ3NzYyOTQxJGozNyRsMCRoMjAxNzQ1MDc2NiRkVi1DWGhDbFBDUmpzYzhTeVIzTGo5UGxmRzBVUHZVZ1pyUQ..) and [Add TrustedForm Consent Tags](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/consent-tagging) to enable all of Verify's features. If leads you are receiving today do not include TrustedForm certificates send those vendors a request with the following message ""Going forward we will require TrustedForm certificates to be sent with all leads we purchase. Please follow these [instructions to implement TrustedForm Certify](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/implementing-trustedform-certify/) so that we may verify and retain proof that each consumer has consented to be contacted."" along with any requirements you set in the next step.

# 2\. Setup your verification criteria

Before you start using Verify you should establish the rules it will use to determine whether or not leads successfully pass the verification process. Visit your [verification criteria page](https://app.trustedform.com/verification_criteria?__hstc=41051389.86c7248b31df171b527bbdb20070d4fa.1748564213681.1748564213681.1748564213681.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564213681&__hsfp=3707738794) and enable the checks you would like perform. Set thresholds and enter any data applicable to each check to properly configure it. Make sure to set the ""Company Legal Name"" to the name that should be shown when consumers grant you consent to contact them if you enabled the [1:1 Consent Check](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5471724-trustedform-verify-1-1-consent-check). Communicate these requirements to your vendors so that they understand and agree to the reasons you may reject or otherwise not use leads.

# 3\. Start using Verify on your inbound leads

To use Verify you must use the [verify operation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Verify/) of the TrustedForm Certificate API. Consult with your development team or software provider to integrate it in such a way that the operation is used on every inbound lead that has a TrustedForm certificate. If you are using LeadConduit, simply add the TrustedForm Add-on to your flow and select the Verify option. Avoid using the result to filter or make any decisions for now.

# 4\. Feed data into Verify

Have your vendors submit test leads from each of their sources or simply allow leads to continue flowing through your process for at least 24 hours to allow Verify to detect the different variations of consent language being used and gauge how well the leads perform against your requirements.

# 5\. Review your results

Visit your [unreviewed consent languages](https://app.trustedform.com/consent_languages/unreviewed?__hstc=41051389.86c7248b31df171b527bbdb20070d4fa.1748564213681.1748564213681.1748564213681.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564213681&__hsfp=3707738794) in TrustedForm's consent language manager and read each record to make sure everything needed for consumers to provide meaningful consent is present. If so mark it as approved. Otherwise, marked it as rejected. Review the results of the Verify operation and inform your vendor about any issues found that need to be corrected. If you need help determining how to assess consent languages read [TCPA Consent: The complete guide for marketers](https://activeprospect.com/blog/tcpa-consent/).

# 6\. Begin filtering leads based on the Verify result

Once you are ready, use the result of the Verify operation to route, flag or reject leads. For a custom or 3rd party integration, make sure it takes action when the Verify is unsuccessful. If using LeadConduit simply add a filter or conditional field mappings when success is false. Anytime you find that leads are failing verification, review the results to determine why and reach out to your vendor to request corrective updates.

# BONUS

If you already have examples of consent languages that you have approved you can add them manually to your list of approved consent languages. Simply click the ""Add Approved Language"" button at the top right of your consent language manager.

# That's It! Your Verify implementation is complete.

Be sure to continue checking your unreviewed consent languages and general results anytime you start receiving leads from a new source as well as periodically so that you are aware of any unexpected sources that get added to your intake.

# If a masked cert is not retained after the 72 hour/90 day window has expired, and the vendor tries to view the Masked Cert Url, will they receive a ""cert not found"" screen like an expired “regular” TF URL?

Correct. A masked certificate has most of the same rules as a regular certificate.

# TrustedForm Verify Contrast Ratio Check

Ensuring that the contrast ratio of consent language compared to used to generate leads compared to its background meets the clear and conspicuous requirement of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) is crucial for compliance and risk mitigation. If the contrast ratio is too small, it could be deemed insufficiently clear, leading to potential regulatory violations, legal challenges, and financial penalties. TrustedForm Verify's Contrast Ratio Check is a new feature that enables you to programmatically verify that each lead was shown a consent language of at least a certain contrast. This can be used to meet [R.E.A.C.H. standards](https://www.reachmbc.com/reach-standards) which require consent language is ""in a color highly contrasting with the background"" and [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) level AAA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced.html) which requires ""The visual presentation of text and images of text has a [contrast ratio](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-enhanced.html#dfn-contrast-ratio) of at least 7:1"".

# How It Works

First, ask your lead vendors to implement [TrustedForm Certify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/certify?_gl=1*1svxali*_gcl_au*NzQzNzM3ODgwLjE3Mzg1OTY4NTUuMTE5Mzg3NzEzLjE3Mzg4ODY5MzQuMTczODg4Njk1Mg..*_ga*OTA3MjA4OTIuMTY5OTQxNDgwMg..*_ga_QHXBV6N7D1*MTczOTkxNjE0OC42MC4xLjE3Mzk5MjA4NjEuNjAuMC4w) and send a TrustedForm Certificate URL along with the leads you purchase from them. This is necessary to give you the required transparency into each lead. Next enable the minimum contrast ratio requirement on your [verification criteria page](https://app.trustedform.com/verification_criteria?__hstc=41051389.f6d07d8c0372aa77c44846f6000198d2.1748564214768.1748564214768.1748564214768.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564214768&__hsfp=3707738794) and click Save.

Next use the [Certificate API](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Certificate-URL/) and make a [Verify request](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Verify/) which will run all of the checks you have enabled (note you can also modify your requirements per query using request parameters). Send the results to the system you use to make purchasing decisions or your CRM depending on where you want to use this data. If you don't have a system that is able to integrate with this feature consider purchasing [LeadConduit](https://activeprospect.com/leadconduit).

The results will include a ""success"" property that should be used to determine how to proceed.

- If ""success"" equals false then that means one of your checks has failed and you should not contact this lead or at least avoid using regulated technology. The ""reason"" property will explain which checks failed and why. Use this along with a potential manual review of the certificate to inform your vendor(s) of the issue(s) that need to be resolved for future leads.
- If ""success"" equals true then that means all of your checks have passed and this lead should continue to progress through your normal processes.

_Note: This check cannot be performed on__certificates generated from Meta Lead Ads or native mobile applications._

# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **What should I set as my minimum contrast ratio?**

There isn't a one size fits all answer to this question but we recommend you consult your compliance/legal teams and industry best practices to determine a suitable minimum for you.
2. **Does using the Contrast Ratio Check satisfy all of the FCC’s  clear and conspicuous requirements?**

No, complying with all of the requirements requires a broad strategy that should be discussed with your compliance/legal teams. However, using the Contrast Ratio Check is an essential defense against common allegations that consent language is unclear or inconspicuous.

# TrustedForm Verify Opt-in Type Check

Ensuring that consumers knowingly opt in before you contact them is the foundation of consent-based marketing—and critical to your business. Lead generation forms use a variety of methods to collect opt-ins, so it’s essential to define which methods are acceptable, communicate those standards to your lead sources, and confirm they’re being followed. For example, [a rule from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/23/2024-07105/medicare-program-changes-to-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare-prescription-drug-benefit#p-1610) requires that consumers take _affirmative action_ to share their data—pre-checked boxes or passive consent aren't enough. TrustedForm Verify’s new Opt-in Type Check feature helps you enforce this standard by programmatically verifying that each lead opted in using an allowed method, such as those defined by CMS.

# How It Works

First, ask your lead vendors to implement [TrustedForm Certify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/certify?_gl=1*1svxali*_gcl_au*NzQzNzM3ODgwLjE3Mzg1OTY4NTUuMTE5Mzg3NzEzLjE3Mzg4ODY5MzQuMTczODg4Njk1Mg..*_ga*OTA3MjA4OTIuMTY5OTQxNDgwMg..*_ga_QHXBV6N7D1*MTczOTkxNjE0OC42MC4xLjE3Mzk5MjA4NjEuNjAuMC4w) and send a TrustedForm Certificate URL along with the leads you purchase from them. This is necessary to give you the required transparency into each lead. Next enable the opt-in type requirement on your [verification criteria page](https://app.trustedform.com/verification_criteria?__hstc=41051389.6062023944b4e6cfc3d72621639c26c5.1748564214438.1748564214438.1748564214438.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564214438&__hsfp=3707738794) and click Save.

Next use the [Certificate API](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Certificate-URL/) and make a [Verify request](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Verify/) which will run all of the checks you have enabled (note you can also modify your requirements per query using request parameters). Send the results to the system you use to make purchasing decisions or your CRM depending on where you want to use this data. If you don't have a system that is able to integrate with this feature consider purchasing [LeadConduit](https://activeprospect.com/leadconduit).

Use this along with a potential manual review of the certificate to inform your vendor(s) of the issue(s) that need to be resolved for future leads.
- If ""success"" equals true then that means all of your checks have passed and this lead should continue to progress through your normal processes.

_Note: This check cannot be performed on__certificates generated from Meta Lead Ads or native mobile applications._

# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **What does the CMS rule say about the type of opt-in used?**

""TPMOs should use a consent method where the default selection is that the beneficiary chooses to not share their data; there should be an affirmative action by the beneficiary to acknowledge that sharing their data with another TPMO is permitted. By being able to consent to each listed TPMO through a clear and conspicuous disclaimer, beneficiaries can make informed decisions that best fit their personal preference."" [Source](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/04/23/2024-07105/medicare-program-changes-to-the-medicare-advantage-and-the-medicare-prescription-drug-benefit#p-1610)
2. **What opt-in types should I allow?**

If you are attempting to comply with the CMS rule mentioned above then you should only allow manual opt-ins as this is the only option where sharing data / giving consent is not the default selection. Otherwise we recommend you consult your compliance/legal teams and industry best practices to determine suitable standards for your business.
3. **Does using the Opt-in Type Check satisfy all of the CMS rule's requirements?**

No, complying with all of the requirements requires a broad strategy that should be discussed with your compliance/legal teams. However, using the Opt-in Type Check is an essential defense against noncompliant leads.

# How do I add TrustedForm Consent Tags when using tiles instead of checkboxes to obtain one-to-one consent?

When [adding TrustedForm consent tags](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/consent-tagging/) you are instructed to add a tag to the checkbox used to allow consumers to select which advertisers they consent to be contacted by. This may seem confusing because some forms visually use selectable tiles instead of checkboxes to get the consumer's input. In these cases, you are still required to maintain a checkbox that represents the consumer's selection in order to add consent tags appropriately. If you do not want to display the checkbox to the consumer, hide it's parent element from view. This allows TrustedForm Certify to document it while maintaining the desired experience for consumers. Ensure that the checkbox accurately represents the consumer's selection to avoid potential disruption or loss of service.

See the below code snippet for inspiration of how to use tiles using checkboxes in your form.

# TrustedForm Verify Approved Language Check

Obtaining meaningful consent from a consumer can be extremely complicated as there are many interpretations of the laws that govern how advertisers perform marketing outreach. These generally result in every business establishing their own set of requirements for the language consumers must consent to in order to become a valid lead. Due to this the best way to ensure that your requirements are met is to review the aforementioned language and only contact leads if you approve of it. TrustedForm Verify's Approved Language Check makes it simple to do this in a scalable manner for all your leads and all the variations of consent language they are shown.

# How It Works

First, ask your lead vendors to implement [TrustedForm Certify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/certify) and send a TrustedForm Certificate URL along with the leads you purchase from them. This will give you access to the consent languages shown to each lead. Next use the [Certificate API](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Certificate-URL/) and make a [Verify request](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Verify/) which will extract the consent languages and make them accessible in the response. It will also add new variations to your [consent language manager](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474006-trustedform-consent-language-manager) as long as there you have less than 1000 unreviewed consent languages. Make sure to review all the consent languages found in the unreviewed section and determine whether future leads using them should be approved or rejected. Once classified, the Approved Language Check will use this to determine if future leads were shown an approved consent language or not. Keep in mind that Verify searches for your approved/rejected consent language within the overall consent language found. This means if you approve the short phrase ""I consent"" then any consent language found that contains that will successfully pass Verify's consent language check (e.g. ""I consent to receive marketing messages""). Passing this check requires an exact match, ignoring case differences, unless you add flexibility using wildcards. You can rely on this to create filters or rules to prevent your business from taking unnecessary risks.

# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Can I approve new consent languages so that they don't get rejected?**

No. New consent languages are just as risky as rejected consent languages which is why they both return ""false"" when the approved language check is used. We recommend having your vendors send test leads anytime they make changes to their consent language so that your have an opportunity to approve it and avoid unnecessary rejections.

New consent languages will come in under the unreviewed section in your [consent language manager](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474006-trustedform-consent-language-manager).
2. **What happens if the lead isn't shown a consent language?**

In this case the approved language check will return ""false"" since an approved consent language was not present. In addition the reason property will contain ""Consent language not detected in the certificate."" to give you additional details if you are investigating why leads fail this check.
3. **Is this the same thing as the page scan feature that is part of TrustedForm Insights?**

No. Page scan is intended to be used if you are looking for the presence of certain words or phrases to infer how the lead was incentivized to complete the form. If you are trying to determine that express written consent was obtained from your leads use Verify. It is specifically designed to search for consent and reduces the workload involved with managing multiple variations of it. Verify will also continue to add features which help manage compliance overall.
4. **Can I manually add consent languages so they are approved before they are shown to my leads?**

Yes. You can [manually add approved language to your consent language manager](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5448162-manually-add-approved-language-to-trustedform-verify-consent-language-manager).
5. **Can I add a wildcard to account for parts of a consent language that may change for each consumer?**

Yes. When adding or editing a consent language you can use the ""Insert Wildcard"" button to replace a dynamic portion of text with our wildcard character. This make consent languages that are the same except for the text represented by wildcards match.
6. **Are consent languages in spanish or other languages automatically translated to english?**

No. All consent languages are preserved as they were displayed. This means that if a consent languages that translate to one of your approved languages will fail is they are written in a different language. To prevent this you'll have to approve consent language variations in all the languages they will be displayed in.

#### Error Response Format

Errors and failures are returned in a structured JSON format with the following fields:

- **outcome**: Indicates the result of the request (e.g., ""error"", ""failure"").
- **reason**: Provides a detailed message explaining the error or failure.

**Example format:**

​x

1

```
{
```

2

```
  ""outcome"": "":error"",
```

3

```
  ""reason"": ""No valid products detected""
```

4

```
}
```

#### Generic Errors

These errors are common across multiple API endpoints.

**No valid products detected**

- **Outcome**: ""error""
- **Reason**: ""No valid products detected""

**Consent language not detected**

- **Outcome**: ""failure""
- **Reason**: ""Consent language not detected in the certificate.""

**Unapproved consent languages**

- **Outcome**: ""failure""
- **Reason**: ""Consent languages found were not approved in the account's consent language manager.""

**For Verify: One to One Consent Check**

**If** use\_tagged\_consent **is set to false or not used in script**

- **Outcome**: ""failure""
- **Reason**: ""This form has not been setup to allow use of One to One Consent Check.""

**Form not submitted or form submission was not detected.**

# What are the benefits of masked certificates?

Masked certificates benefit lead resellers by shielding the identity of their lead originator from the lead buyer.

Lead buyers who accept masked certificates exhibit confidence that the reseller will be willing and able to provide the full, unmasked  certificate in the future, should it be necessary to resolve a consumer complaint.

# If someone retained a TrustedForm masked certificate and the vendor who claimed the original canceled their account (and purged their certificates), would we be able to give them the full certificate knowing the original was deleted?

No. If you accept masked certificates from a provider you are relying on them to have retained the full certificate and that they will be willing and able to provide it to you when needed.

# TrustedForm Verify Font Size Check

Ensuring that the font size of consent language used to generate leads meets the clear and conspicuous requirement of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) is crucial for compliance and risk mitigation. If the font size is too small, it could be deemed insufficiently clear, leading to potential regulatory violations, legal challenges, and financial penalties. TrustedForm Verify's Font Size Check is a new feature that enables you to programmatically verify that each lead was shown a consent language of at least a certain size. This can be used to meet [R.E.A.C.H. standards](https://www.reachmbc.com/reach-standards) which require consent language ""must appear in not less than 10 point font"" and confirm this for every lead before you contact them.

# How It Works

First, ask your lead vendors to implement [TrustedForm Certify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/certify?_gl=1*1svxali*_gcl_au*NzQzNzM3ODgwLjE3Mzg1OTY4NTUuMTE5Mzg3NzEzLjE3Mzg4ODY5MzQuMTczODg4Njk1Mg..*_ga*OTA3MjA4OTIuMTY5OTQxNDgwMg..*_ga_QHXBV6N7D1*MTczOTkxNjE0OC42MC4xLjE3Mzk5MjA4NjEuNjAuMC4w) and send a TrustedForm Certificate URL along with the leads you purchase from them. This is necessary to give you the required transparency into each lead. Next enable the minimum font size requirement on your [verification criteria page](https://app.trustedform.com/verification_criteria?__hstc=41051389.ab1f908b568bfa9b2be84914116c78f2.1748564216690.1748564216690.1748564216690.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564216690&__hsfp=3707738794) and click Save.

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/817/842/original.png?f=1739920130&Expires=1748567810&Signature=J-iM0DSd1sWKmwQ8PI0I5Ajwa9oK27PMAaw0OQVccPUGJr6C1tysq9AprHMLAGUjrMo62Mg6ecU4JzDxjCJbPMclgkk1QO02smNdDzw-FM406KhMB71rEGptRSxNmAxdGe80Hau3Erx51wn6NYYSYYlfmXUeYRD6Fvau0wIj06YC3eeS0GXo10eUVw7Cd2eTJGlYrvyaReHn56hinR3zMc~crPpsKZ2G-idtC6zBR~XjnQfS42fy3Do0ZDsMbhhJPYLyFfqGqcEYnFxVVjLvdVIorieCQAzLN3Og3uMuzDUBCu3hc0FifkVho15X-dyvtp1m6dE7eVry-Lhxw9~sCw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)Next use the [Certificate API](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Certificate-URL/) and make a [Verify request](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Verify/) which will run all of the checks you have enabled **(note you can also modify your requirements per query using request parameters)**. Send the results to the system you use to make purchasing decisions or your CRM depending on where you want to use this data. If you don't have a system that is able to integrate with this feature consider purchasing [LeadConduit](https://activeprospect.com/leadconduit).

The results will include a ""success"" property that should be used to determine how to proceed.

- If ""success"" equals false then that means one of your checks has failed and you should not contact this lead or at least avoid using regulated technology. The ""reason"" property will explain which checks failed and why. Use this along with a potential manual review of the certificate to inform your vendor(s) of the issue(s) that need to be resolved for future leads.
- If ""success"" equals true then that means all of your checks have passed and this lead should continue to progress through your normal processes.

_Note: This check cannot be performed on__certificates generated from Meta Lead Ads or native mobile applications._

# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Does the Font Size Check account for zoom level currently applied to a web page?**

No, the font size reported is based on the computed size of the text and does not change based on the zoom level of the web page.
2. **Does using the Font Size Check satisfy all of the FCC’s  clear and conspicuous requirements?**

No, complying with all of the requirements requires a broad strategy that should be discussed with your compliance/legal teams. However, using the Font Size Check is an essential defense against common allegations that consent language is unclear or inconspicuous.
3. **If there are multiple consent languages which one does the font size check compare against?**

All of them. The logic used by the font size check looks at all the consent languages shown and finds the font size of the smallest one. If this font size is smaller than what you have set as your minimum then the result will be a failure.

# Implementing TrustedForm on 123FormBuilders

How to add TrustedForm to a 123FormBuilders form.

Begin by logging into your FormBuilders account.

Select the form you want to use with TrustedForm by clicking edit or create a new form:

Click on the 'Set up' tab:

Then click on the 'Form' tab. Then select 'Add a JS script to your form'.

Here we will be entering the URL of a .js file which holds the TrustedForm script.

To do that, first create a JS file that holds our TrustedForm script, then upload the JS file on a trusted web server or your own and use the URL where the file is located (e.g. https://mydomain.com/my-javascript.js). There are web services that host JavaScript files for you, but they represent certain risks, such as data corruption or service retirement. That’s the reason why it is best to host them on a web service where you have administrative access.

Once you have entered the URL of the JS file, click on 'Save', as follows:

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/923/784/original.png?f=1697077679&Expires=1748567816&Signature=PA1qs9AAYrzwEPf9golfWZL3k-3g2GequM-rAsCZwoRaP2M9ZmxbPItRYCnerdQ2qlf~gL8ALtwHjIjH~AhuSt3GmmnyFjNwdhCHyMeE~QY6MxTdhUau8JHUa9SpJ4pZeiEJ8Ca5~C~ZPoHrZvcsdOdO2D3v8RE-41UW3~KTRDWtM2mTMtASXESVXBByzDVpOfI01X3QRG77k42ni-hKf57fmPQTKEKKabKl5q3gsum-uT~SwWOwZTm398O9P2-CxN2rejpKS6QrvtzWrIbn-qETsRTEmSzkw9OxLR0LTFb4qsueDhAw-RCloevEo5iXu3UULtGrLxbCX~uwXD56hQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

That's it! Now you should be able to publish and test the form, and the certificates should be created successfully.

# Implementing TrustedForm on Formidable

How to add TrustedForm to a Formidable form.

Open WordPress, and navigate to Formidable forms, and here either create a form( 'Add New' ) or open an existing form. In the example below, we're using a simple contact form.

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/928/462/original.png?f=1697487648&Expires=1748567816&Signature=ubK7oRt1NzoGVMebH8AI9WAwlMfSvyydvAL9MrBMndeVRegZ6MobhpiaG5gZkc6bb2vhDcAT-9o8MTxwNKY5Smd1kKRJF75IRf6dmH6Lt6cq-u0bIL0RLSODwbllxkthB0iARYCK8nHy3yvR6uqzjeVMpcnv62kQZ5uDYE~B0z-YH2PtgfKV-hXUntDzwVvh6jtXKmWKtbAf1JJjenSN0OSzY8DJoUGO6JpF9T73LneOjOJ224glqwwQ-60y-I6LI4Uc6g1WCogNNZDCEBBV64yrk3TpctPcyDwg0ZzvFpczC18FbQoxynGvL3owSjwiL7WChlIPODr4yhTRW3WsOg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Make sure you're under the 'Build' page. Now click on '</> HTML' on the left side bar.

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/928/469/original.png?f=1697488035&Expires=1748567816&Signature=lh6C4RSoqvptRilmXYZdWsXhfBfWpuFuN7B80Za1KcZD2da7HU77-0RMJMtA4H1f9jXqvJ6lYUoYdRJdFFUHOk92x3zkYOMUTzxY7YWf6sdXnDVWmRbACDX1ylBezh9K5K3TXIAQY3-7zQMwG15~5ngHUBuGXP4-AAFxdEG4528NNnkKqaN3e7qiDnRntCMOlSMxJJsmiIfPx5mJ3h~TxPAbrVOq7gtXwtRZaG6Sy4uzv-t3j2pm2d4D9POXgqMghwLa-Bl62hYLcHKUZ-LU2fAR4Hq7CuqGC0ulqJ90XPidl~z6Y1unMZh5qxPy5V9b3nHYy9~S6KqqMseSpvNG3A__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

As soon as you click, an HTML block would get added to you form, make sure it gets added just before the submit button, if not, then drag and change its position, so it's placed before the submit button.

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/928/477/original.png?f=1697488135&Expires=1748567816&Signature=QvXEQrQvldwpzfy4UUz5J5ak0TGOND8Lu09aeKM8ZFowZQ1iUxjC-npk2cYSjx8wCD5kyF-4nSlztNtf-6MZtP11fw9yXG4bHdHK9aCpkJRsViwnfLb1oqK~LiM9xq7TLlqsk4qv6WmpEnn8Yrr~UKjnQrD1NbFbvbGJATnqSnO8zas2NSL68u-ExBLWVNC6CTR0chZPoh7XxW8h0Qlnm0nQaqCmLrU1drkhIiX3E6KXq9V6DfUQ2H-oQbt3yXGhQymCV9Wr86fD0TIR-M-ZeRoBqxARbbxV~B75cKBzrCeouDZEGB~OHMF-ScphgakgNvpfY1cq7WJIaEzvJ~8vUQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Now click on the 'Custom HTML' block, and a small 'Content' window will appear in the left side bar, here you copy and paste the TrustedForm script, then click on 'Update' button on the top right corner.

**To get the TrustedForm script:**

- Log into your Trusted Form ActiveProspect account, then navigate to the Certify tab.
- Here you will find the TrustedForm script under 'Javascript Snippet', copy this script.

That's it! Now you should be able to preview and test the form, and certificates should be created successfully. Look for the hidden field (xxTrustedFormCertUrl) in the inspect tool, which is where you'll find the certificate URL.

# Form / Formbuilder/Landing Page Audit

keywords: formbuilders, form builders, forms

Ever wondered which integration to use for your forms or landing pages? Look no further! We've done the hard work for you by making a list of compatible systems, noting which products they work with best, and adding any notes we thought might be helpful. If you're curious about an integration not listed here, please contact our Support team and we'd be happy to chat with you further.

DISCLAIMER: This audit is based off our investigation of these services. It is possible that these integrations have made updates since we last investigated them and could now be compatible. Please reach out directly to these companies to determine the latest status.

NOTE: LeadConduit is ""LC"" and TrustedForm is ""TF"".

# How do I add TrustedForm Consent Tags when using logos/images instead of text to obtain one-to-one consent?

When [adding TrustedForm consent tags](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/consent-tagging/) you are instructed to add a tag to the text identifying the advertiser being granted consent to contact. This may seem confusing because some forms use the advertiser's logo or an image to show the consumer who may contact them. However, you must still include text that contains the advertiser's name as shown to the consumer to properly add consent tags. If you prefer not to display this text to the consumer, you can hide it's parent element it from view. This allows TrustedForm Certify to document it while maintaining the desired experience for consumers. Ensure that the text accurately represents the advertiser name shown in the image or logo to avoid potential disruption or loss of service.

See the below example for inspiration of how to add this to your form.

# Implementing TrustedForm on WordPress with Gravity Forms

How to add TrustedForm to a WordPress site using a single-page GravityForms form.

To implement the TrustedForm script and begin submitting TrustedForm Certificate URLs with GravityForms leads, follow the steps below.

Open WordPress, and navigate to GravityForms, and here either create a form( 'Add New' ) or open an existing form. In the example below, we're using a contact form.

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/211/234/original.png?f=1709596693&Expires=1748567804&Signature=tstht7feL~JPTQpahMQDZf4TrCbCQvmFgPYTh2aIbr55IJ8yMrriSfzr9IrqOrzksYE69pwrb8fjFeGtlI8b~HrXuy74xn77kCzT4mNsKgpdGBS3Y1ETUXuwBZP3Lk2iXJfzebM9wq4T8sHLNPHOaqIsN42WJ66fmeJYxkqNTUlT0u~btVnn8TuTW~21jiWz0vpj~RZjLHWHcPC~xukEBWNM63~k7qW3wy2uE7gyRcpIhCZl6dDsb9D6ECg8AXS~nNrduNnzLiezxI0LItgIJbv5ATRvqiYoAa43YNzUqWFzxyvvlwl5yz3i1pxKBstaAqTUm3NHn-QdpvGZpLHMRw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

**Adding the TrustedForm Script to your GravityForms Page**

Now in the GravityForms editor, let’s add The TrustedForm script to our form page.

From the right side bar, under 'Add Fields' > 'Standard fields' look for an '<> HTML' field.

Now click and drag an “HTML” block onto the page and make sure to add it just before the submit button. Click on the HTML Content block, then on the right side bar expand the “General”  section so you can see the “Content” block.

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/211/245/original.png?f=1709598018&Expires=1748567804&Signature=ZmytSCkHHY8bx7wo8MdZkc67lKmecOrqkSLTslN6i5F0jh1Gd2JI2ZWy0Ym7CN~S9w4mC9FrmoxkWDfIyMQ3mou3L8qz4Qaw~rh2OxF5pDEF3Sst98wL4tmmwAWoVXHUDv7RTMS~P3Ukej0mvxJhjrf7qD-xGcKBex8dcfEWzeiYf8HyDp1lgO7qqJgkcS9P9H6rsn9y2YQGF95-JPh4IO1~50ZGnO4c9fRK9lZW3r6aB~5O6kNNPWVnjvHHlGaB~HKWookEMO9iftifxEG7sIlNsA1ZcHzE4EJB5wi8b9RNZ3AQkawPEHR2LA4pgW9eRRbyId2H1JwWNJ-KHlWDYw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

You’re now going to paste the TrustedForm script into the Content block and update the form to save your changes.

**To get the TrustedForm script:**

- Log into your Trusted Form ActiveProspect account, then navigate to the Certify tab.
- Here you will find the TrustedForm script under 'Javascript Snippet (Web SDK)', copy this script.

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/211/247/original.png?f=1709598130&Expires=1748567804&Signature=GnKTQJzyHKGVvQOPHhrpz1vnG6aFDZxGcf0F4YnEgKr8014xBALxRCGMBW33XMp4P07NpY4-ML6cUdOubUVh58aipRjWURX~NsRA9xSFwMQquy3335d1wbomDOwguy9sDys44fSPyuRj-rXfBxmrPkvUiuIlAGK0koRNNyfX~Tat6SkHtzo4~STNhuR9MyZobu0x3Dqe5ODtWHkCRueJhTP-M7IPWGD~xG9AoJKh9pgR-Fj1o4a8VH7r11O895kZVr70fSwEnuu136lvTNSJRI95LzUE~G0CGZi4ifmJ5uLbcWD5f-xp4l33~kbf3ehhtFfi8Y9kd5HdemOWrwGkjA__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

# That's it! Now you should be able to preview and test the form, and certificates should be created successfully.

# Checking Whether the Script Is Working

You can check a loaded form page for the presence of a populated hidden field named ""xxTrustedFormCertUrl\_0"" in the browser's page DOM by using the browser's ""inspect"" feature. Look for the hidden field (xxTrustedFormCertUrl) in the inspect tool, which is where you'll find the certificate URL.

If you’ve done everything right, you’ll see an “https:// cert.trustedform.com…” url as the hidden field’s value.

**How to adjust the SDK to insert the Certificate URL into your Gravity Forms hidden field**

**Step 1:**Insert a hidden field into your form within GravityForms.

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/454/348/original.png?f=1724438084&Expires=1748567804&Signature=EdR75pH38q6Ggag5BwhT-z~~X5XEE2Omblct0yazq3yWVtqcmSJq4iGwaoq5EPzcjly5sifR5krTI1CPR9SVl4MzViOBUEy~tsDeiWj71G-95cwXesd4QD13eb43I5nklPP0E9UO0wNp3e0WTxKoI5Hxz~DxPSPcNBnKBOgclm5MWANrO~Nz5QohZJyVFmWblwXMe3CmJUXR4HeG~KRwqVSYCD2XizxqA2jU53H0KVHlSn-aVIsdKf9JpKMz5rqe9OvCc7j8qEiEdqiCvZxbgJz7AGW9QSxL~ufP8EsRkex1tyWn0~ivNeNVY5DXHXcEtJ-3YpV-PxAqBMQrCod-CQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

**Step 2:** Save the form, and then note the ID assigned to your hidden field by checking the hidden field settings in the top-right corner. In our example, the ID is 6. This ID is used to name the hidden field, and it will typically be formatted as **input\_ID**, so in this case, it will be **input\_6**.

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/454/355/original.png?f=1724438220&Expires=1748567804&Signature=cr-OQesSLlKaluagmt2thW-mFzYUb7K9cyOlV4PUnZiSinZzPidKKLC7lj8a8KzwcPQsstcoUhXkGnuz8aXjTVeOxfIts-Y65tfsAn5c5tdrv4CG9g9UjN~nUkYdI16wgMMFeaiLfi04xKf92XEFIX8oH391mBVFMoGdlfHniD0010CruJcb9m3Rkx55-MHKZtly95146H6E3sFWHssRY7q1AzelmoKR00FgsUemrwFqhLpYkuS99-Q8HxhHef3G8tE3CLW7vqmmMj-FVSQ6U7E4Z7eVJySMAwDz~vdpw~5Z6ZZgk02uHUt08pMuVcxghyxf4tSVgt~6RkzpCLhP~Q__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

You can also obtain this information by following these steps:

- Visit your website and open the page you want to inspect using your browser's developer tools.
- Locate the hidden field in your form, which should have a class of ""gform\_hidden"".
- Take note of the input name assigned by Gravity Forms (e.g., **input\_6**)

**Step 3:** Go to the [certify tab](https://app.trustedform.com/certificates/issue?__hstc=41051389.b94d25e7fa675c1dd50cabd5b15b9252.1748564224459.1748564224459.1748564224459.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564224459&__hsfp=3707738794) of your TrustedForm account to edit the field names used in the Javascript Snippet (SDK). Navigate to the Script Configurations section, then update the ""Field"" blank to match the input name assigned to your hidden field by Gravity Forms. As you update the 'Field', the Javascript Snippet below gets updated too.

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/454/419/original.png?f=1724439525&Expires=1748567804&Signature=bbFeX7CfGa1zd~mF4rkrun2xef8A1nEq8Z0TMbTXr8bVUWfIBRLdfKiF7zmVYtTySDNrtzIdhddq~0XN46sPmxpLOkkwKPXhag8MXcvILOdkOBVbrqBctKf37qdfiHFCnDXeX7fxjp6lU6GWbgHfBP06SsyPs2uJqDtkjWrZTagtdrAM7GOjD6Rn7HtmF6kmChpvQbu9YWupq53JJlHHe4u-MHcYqGZ6-4P57yhwsgUvCNa3BBNC1X5BXzUc63yBYkZQRiEYJzzCgcrOiuOEUeocHAYe-aMYy9MwTnNtSn7nhi0REQdbWvI-AIzx3T2eYTdJpwHxSZE8tkhQ4Fr9vg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

**Step 4:** Now copy the modified Javascript Snippet (SDK) and insert it into your Gravity Forms, in the same place you added the SDK previously.

After this, the TrustedForm Certificate should be inserted into the hidden field you created.

# Manually Add Approved Language to TrustedForm Verify Consent Language Manager

[TrustedForm's Consent Language Manager](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474006-trustedform-consent-language-manager) includes a manual option to add approved consent languages. This should only be used if you already know the text that will be used as the consent language for leads you are purchasing and are unwilling to feed data into Verify as described in the [implementation guide](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5253900-trustedform-verify-implementation-guide). This method is not recommended. Any discrepancy in the expected consent language versus the actual received consent language will result in duplicates. However, this approach may be necessary to meet unique business requirements.

# How It Works

All manually-added consent languages will appear under the Approved tab. This is because there is no value in manually adding a rejected consent language since the Verify operation will have the same outcome for rejected and new consent language. To do this click the ""Add Approved Language"" button in the top right corner of your Consent Language Manager.

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/404/786/original.png?f=1722271363&Expires=1748567822&Signature=NZTVXDCEX7LhLvDP3nC2FE4YfsIf2mafxy7vnCe8DjSIPYoHwwz693BNeeg-AbEWt-J6b7GoS0y4BioRbfH9ov1RoEEyAbv7nfq2bK~HfKMana0Gplry8wLrFjVEMy2~VMQ0Jk6HU5V3kaQP0eZ-bPKpHkI75hFGMpWmDlgWCajsU6iPVy5fslpSr-IJF28gwJAv9HuIm376LnqED319AnJWMBWeX7U6xhN~RXIwEkePnDZK6AKW2bn4D3SMq-i8dhCmVAz7ltqvNlJcu6WfWzsw1qFGr5C9jAV0OxeAdzI14UnOFbOCkoi7C~kvhuAL55HVux7iGKvYe3VI7X1BVg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Specify the name, text and optionally any notes for each consent language. Choose a name that describes unique details about the consent language you would use to identify it later such as the vendor who uses it, the website it appears on, the date it was put into use, etc. Ensure you use the same text that your legal/compliance team has approved and that your vendor has confirmed will be presented to the leads you purchase.

If there are parts of the consent language that are dynamic (e.g. consumer information, button text, advertiser information), insert a wildcard in their place by clicking the ' **Insert Wildcard {{\*}}**' button. You can also use new placeholders like **{{phone}}** for phone numbers and **{{email}}** for email addresses to ensure consistency across variations. Using a wildcard or placeholder will allow consent languages detected from your certificates to be matched with your approved consent languages regardless of what text appears in their place. Make sure the rest of the text constitutes valid consent language and that you don't expect the portion captured by the wildcard or placeholder to affect that. Add notes with any other useful information you may want to keep track of, like who created the consent language and when.

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/791/591/original.png?f=1738255778&Expires=1748567822&Signature=L2PRz803lKh~yymtQrJihXBcuFwx4ctQ-JUHKx6aD1iCPkm3t0sfrr7vbpckxDVA4AIzH97Uo9tEq52-S6prNZ~TofbvJhHX7PcPa~h28gqrGSvibMKfXgMMzTr1C9gJWwx8MgI7~yk4cQ~QeSlZbcGK4ptazcWZbUlpKhuI8PBgStUqc4VJyKbk0258n0Fhw0ZrcMKR0L8vjDYykuCkxz0DHf~bEmd-bEZqrv7YNuEQq3WYMlvNr3juX-IS52kSnoSxCJxxT51JH2uCaLNUO00Np9-Ue5MZckaXMjjfe~8Nsj7NUoMnkAo85n5WSqB18f-Nmj6fZi3RySr3v~cgag__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Finally, click the ""Add Consent Language"" button and your new consent language will be created and approved!

# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Why do I have to name my consent languages?**

Naming your consent languages makes it easier for you and your colleagues to identify them later.

2. **Can I add a wildcard without using the button?**

Yes. The wildcard button simply inserts {{\*}} into your consent language text. If you add that yourself it will still be treated as a wildcard.

3. **Can I add consent languages in bulk?**

This is a feature that we are working on. It will allow you to upload a .csv file with all the approved consent languages you want to add. Keep an eye on [whatsnew.activeprospect.com](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/) to find out when this becomes available.

# That's it! Now you should be able to preview and test the form, and certificates should be created successfully.

# Checking Whether the Script Is Working

You can check a loaded form page for the presence of a populated hidden field named ""xxTrustedFormCertUrl\_0"" in the browser's page DOM by using the browser's ""inspect"" feature. Look for the hidden field (xxTrustedFormCertUrl) in the inspect tool, which is where you'll find the certificate URL.

If you’ve done everything right, you’ll see an “https:// cert.trustedform.com…” url as the hidden field’s value.

**How to adjust the SDK to insert the Certificate URL into your Gravity Forms hidden field**

**Step 1:**Insert a hidden field into your form within GravityForms.

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/454/348/original.png?f=1724438084&Expires=1748567823&Signature=RJG5PrLtt~3piBDOeTQ7XmrI9eAQBdI9bJ7-HklC~6TttEUJxLwI154t61l5bJzp8d9matQAlMnv0uzUoNPSFwfu3cFVbA8Tk0BGi9SAYDYhsqiAPK50YiS2gS02xkheM0ocdlM-dWuyJC6gAFCagHODCkRaif7Q8m7NGweDurLiCUvhvLYnNfiuJ8rzOtqFc9SqjFknSE3wKElkfs6ZGzKEkt7xn6g0S0gBvi7tTUHV5Qyhbb8DP727w6s8kETsi96JeZsTau0wQxMad6cOsV5ThzeMt4ZnEY~5Duc6JlzEB5LWbDa1eOL0lMFnnv~7lCxQAUE9rd598N7GPtsAYQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

**Step 2:** Save the form, and then note the ID assigned to your hidden field by checking the hidden field settings in the top-right corner. In our example, the ID is 6. This ID is used to name the hidden field, and it will typically be formatted as **input\_ID**, so in this case, it will be **input\_6**.

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/454/355/original.png?f=1724438220&Expires=1748567823&Signature=VvKJiMDsr9e~6cez6scJF9GWSUCsFfsJIhgFtE6TZWRzkdtSjTra-RHrjbTQ8RiC1r~hW9wdfZn4OldGHlbKI1nIAbHnTamrdBhPuh2tmVEp11ntHp9xMvCLdU-C6~O8Clad~hSdd3Eha3byqI5kxC-HM0ivjSuXBMvhFl7rdx7QvbKB0hCV6XiF7v0DEo9fNY5L9tk9E06QAKHy~xz24B~kKY6IDhNqp42EgdNN8UNLSbNf9bbwBn-FYEFWXFB~ZL-6jcJnFocNRu50SEpwUClnl8sPqOUPT-MnMrQSxZInpFwfHowAefM9nc7EZa6mRIvfe1AnTXAnNTQns-glWw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

You can also obtain this information by following these steps:

- Visit your website and open the page you want to inspect using your browser's developer tools.
- Locate the hidden field in your form, which should have a class of ""gform\_hidden"".
- Take note of the input name assigned by Gravity Forms (e.g., **input\_6**)

Navigate to the Script Configurations section, then update the ""Field"" blank to match the input name assigned to your hidden field by Gravity Forms. As you update the 'Field', the Javascript Snippet below gets updated too.

**Step 4:** Now copy the modified Javascript Snippet (SDK) and insert it into your Gravity Forms, in the same place you added the SDK previously.

After this, the TrustedForm Certificate should be inserted into the hidden field you created.

# TrustedForm Consent Language Manager

The TrustedForm Consent Language Manager (CLM) is used to keep track of which variations of consent language your business has approved to be presented to the leads you contact. It will be automatically populated with consent languages found when TrustedForm [Retain](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/retain) or [Verify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/verify) are used. We recommend consulting with your legal/compliance team to determine whether specific variations meet their requirements and are safe for you to use. Any variation you approve should be sufficient on its own to comply with the advertising/marketing regulations applicable to your business such as the [Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_Consumer_Protection_Act_of_1991). The classifications established here will be used to conduct [TrustedForm Verify's Approved Language Check](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474009-trustedform-verify-approved-language-check) to help your business mitigate risk by giving you the means to reject or flag leads that were generated without proper consent.

# How It Works

There are 3 sections of the CLM that help you manage the approval process of consent languages with the least effort possible. These should be regularly reviewed to ensure that you are properly vetting your leads.

**Unreviewed Consent Language**

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/484/802/original.png?f=1726268273&Expires=1748567822&Signature=kINFrJ~n4ADCfqSDVcJV1lMGRq05kWvupKm4O354tLMVUeWXNSMqAoVk0OJZKj-YlOF6oRRU4Vbm-RERnN5Re2QaJEfL2E4ySETV0uVZktvMFMFjwKnTsx6~oGVkTCgriQXUu7t6bjG9fG~ciflIwtOsr6ByQCPRLii4yHTEzZ5WKB8jSZYVoDuHVfFP3OfuZlweb1GlPEq38VzC4WojXo9t3r86iLJjR0~1eXzglFo9O36mgwN612ZlGNwdkpgsAmlE6V-FeBJqymFWhfW7ZYm-h0DISSQX9uJHfa2yKEcGhkkl0A0OuIykVOGjcT5adpNtW2~y4nK~SP2nTIKsvQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

This section shows you variations that have appeared on TrustedForm certificates that you have verified or retained but haven't been classified yet. This is the most important section to take action on to ensure that you accept/reject the leads that you want to. Sort columns like first/last seen or count to help you determine which variations are the most important to review. Phone numbers and email addresses will now appear as placeholders, **{{phone}}** and **{{email}}**,to prevent unnecessary duplicates. This section has a limit of 1000 consent languages so make sure to review them regularly so that there is always space for newly detected consent languages.

![](https://content2.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/791/836/original.png?f=1738257465&Expires=1748567822&Signature=BQCCG00XRXKTIyzLDTp0CWlLmCcrvyznU1jj6TVNdJU2h5WX0hS1KLdSgORbd7Gvw9Xw0OP2OW-Lvk~8QYjDt426IXtJSlZWgnQZj6tfMkPXDwqgWHTz6w2PHTRcDr9D2T5sHywirbLVdq6eKch4JNi2xfoMSzhSg~JfspkZetEdk0n~tK4DfoVgncra94pF6IyA66n5igSKmyqweqLRh-ymbPeIoiDxSPASKWkTdWHrSZdfyQqo4htz9D8I4lb6fxBj14OWdDrMlyOlw~gVkBtmmyO7Wn8T12DmoGDco8dHKKEXrZOFG7mRUIM8KzXsk19AYY0IXZFbnz14Y--Rew__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

This section shows you variations which you have already approved. It is important to update these if your business requirements change. Leave notes on each variation so that you can keep track of the reasoning behind approving it or changes made to it.

**Rejected Consent Language**

# TrustedForm Verify

Verify is a TrustedForm product offering that allows you to assess if a consumer gave their express written consent to be contacted when purchasing 3rd party leads. You can set rules that enable you to determine whether lead events meet the requirements set by your legal and/or compliance teams to keep your business safe and ensure the consumers you contact wanted you to reach out. By making a simple API call you will be able to verify the following:

- You have approved the consent language presented during the lead event
- The consumer specifically and explicitly consented to hear from your company
- The consent language was presented in a clear and conspicuous manner

# How It Works

Ask your lead vendors to implement [TrustedForm Certify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/certify) and send a TrustedForm Certificate URL along with the leads you purchase from them. Then use our [Certificate API](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Certificate-URL/) to make a request to verify your lead and send the results to the system you use to make purchasing decisions.The API response will inform you if the certificate meets the requirements you have set. If not, you may want to immediately reject the lead, flag it for a manual review, or use non-regulated contact methods. If your requirements are met make sure to retain the certificate so that you have proof of the consent you have verified and you can confidently purchase the lead and contact the consumer

Verify makes the following checks available to enforce the requirements you have set for your leads:

- [Approved Language Check](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474009-trustedform-verify-approved-language-check)
- [Font Size Check](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5561944-trustedform-verify-font-size-check)
- [Contrast Ratio Check](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5561943-trustedform-verify-contrast-ratio-check)
- [Opt-in Type Check](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5619028-trustedform-verify-opt-in-type-check)
- [1:1 Consent Check](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5471724-trustedform-verify-1-1-consent-check)

View the [implementation guide](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5253900-trustedform-verify-implementation-guide) for help getting started.

# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **How do I get access to TrustedForm Verify?**

New customers should contact [sales@activeprospect.com](mailto:sales@activeprospect.com). Contracted customers must contact their account manager for purchase. Self-service customers must enable it in the [Features hub](https://account.activeprospect.com/features).

2. **Will this allow me to view and retain TrustedForm certificates?**

No, in order to view TrustedForm certificates you must use TrustedForm Retain to get view access and retain certificates in your account.

3. **How should I communicate the requirements I have set in Verify to my lead vendors?**

TrustedForm Verify can be used to enforce requirements and check them in an automated fashion. However, communication of these to your vendor must still be handled independently of TrustedForm. We recommend you document your requirements, send them to your vendors and get confirmation that they have made any necessary changes before you begin rejecting leads that fail your acceptance criteria.

4. **How do I use the API?**

Verify is available as part of the TrustedForm Certificate API once your account has been given access to it. You must have a development team that is able to build a custom solution using the [verify operation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Verify/) or a lead distribution software that has integrated with TrustedForm Verify. If your current software does not support this reach out to their team to request it or consider using [ActiveProspect's LeadConduit](https://activeprospect.com/leadconduit/) which stays up to date with all of TrustedForm's newest features and product offerings.

5. **Can Verify be used with masked certificates?**

Yes. Masked certificates obscure the source from which they were generated. Verify does not inherently reveal any information directly about the source so it can be used with a masked certificate. If information about the source of a website is revealed in it's consent language then it is the publisher's responsibility to make any necessary edits to their consent language to prevent this in the future.

6. **What are the possible Verify failures?** Visit the [documentation here](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5415514-trustedform-possible-failure-outcomes-on-api-v4-0) to learn about the possible failure outcomes under Verify.

7. **Can I test Verify without rejecting leads?**

Yes, Verify itself doesn't cause your leads to be rejected. It returns a determination of whether or not they met specified criteria. Generally a lead distribution system such as LeadConduit will manages lead rejection. This means to test Verify without rejecting your leads you should set up a process that will make a Verify request to get the information and report on it but not act on it until you are ready.

8. **Is there a way to set up different criteria for different sources, locations or types of leads?**

TrustedForm Verify does not have this capability directly, but this possible using LeadConduit. LeadConduit gives users the flexibility to build flows with steps that only run under certain conditions. By taking advantage of this you can customize your Verify request using any of the data available with your lead.

# Do I need an AWS account to use Firehose?

Yes, and you’ll need to [configure an S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/create-destination.html) with the [appropriate permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html). It’s important that you scope the amount of access ActiveProspect has to your account by creating an IAM user.

# TrustedForm: How to use API version 4.0

TrustedForm Certificate API v4.0 is the latest and recommended version when using the TrustedForm product offering. View [Introducing TrustedForm Certificate API v4.0](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5066720-introducing-trustedform-certificate-api-v4-0) for more details about what's new. All self-service customers using older versions must make changes to their API requests to begin using v4.0 by **January 1, 2024**.

Professional and Enterprise customers who would like to use it should contact their client success manager to gain access before making an attempt. Below are a few easy steps to help you make the necessary changes.

**1\. Add ""api-version: 4.0"" as a HTTP header to your existing request**

The [api-version header](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Certificate-URL/#tag/Certificate-URL/operation/runOperations!in=header&path=api-version&t=request) is how the TrustedForm Certificate API determines which version of the request/response structure to use to interpret and process your request. You will only have access to the support versions released after the version your account is configured to use. You can check this by visiting [https://app.trustedform.com/settings](https://app.trustedform.com/settings?__hstc=41051389.878e47cf92028a7aea017536738b0668.1748564168768.1748564168768.1748564168768.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564168768&__hsfp=3707738794).

​x

1

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

2

```
Authorization: Basic ************************************************
```

3

```
Api-Version: 4.0
```

**2\. Add the** [**retain**](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Retain/#tag/Retain/schema/RetainParameters) **and** [**match\_lead**](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Match-Lead/#tag/Match-Lead/schema/MatchLeadParameters) **objects to your request body**

One of the biggest changes in v4.0 is that you must now pass the operations you would like to execute as part of your request. This enables us to expand the operations you are able to perform and offer new products as part of the same API over time. As a self service customer you currently only have access to the Retain product. View the [retain operation section of our API documentation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Retain/) for details on how to format your request. Please include both the match\_lead and retain operation in your request, as in the following example of a payload:

```
xxxxxxxxxx
```

1

10

1

```
{
```

2

```
  ""match_lead"": {
```

3

```
    ""email"": ""consumeremail@gmail.com"",
```

4

```
    ""phone"": ""3033294595""
```

5

```
  },
```

6

```
  ""retain"": {
```

7

```
    ""reference"": ""Weblead"",
```

8

```
    ""vendor"": ""Vendor Name""
```

9

```
  }
```

10

```
}
```

**3\. Make any necessary adjustments to your integration**

If you were previously ingesting any information from the response provided by the TrustedForm Certificate API please see the new Retain Response in the [retain operation section of our API documentation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Retain/) and use the new path to retrieve the properties you want. We recommend using the [outcome](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Certificate-URL/#tag/Certificate-URL/operation/runOperations!c=200&path=outcome&t=response) property to determine your next steps. You can find our [full API documentation here](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/getting-started/).

When outcome is...

**""success""** \- No action is necessary. The certificate has been retained in your account.

**""failure""** \- The certificate has been retained in your account but as failed to meet best practices. Please review the value in the ""reason"" property and manually review the certificate before contacting your lead.

**""error""** \- The certificate could not be retained. Please review the value in the ""reason"" property for an explanation, correct the problem and try again.

**That's it! Now you are using version 4.0 of the TrustedForm Certificate API.**

# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Will versions 2.0 and 3.0 stop working?**

Yes previous versions will be sunset and no longer available after **December 31** **st, 2023 for Self-Service customers**. If you're in this group you should have received an email notification explaining this.

2. **How does this affect self-service pricing?**

Your pricing for API usage will not change until you start using version 4.0. The product offering in the v4.0 API is different, with different pricing.  Depending on your needs and usage, your costs may vary.

Customers using v2.0 will be switching from a flat fee per certificate to our tiered structure. Once your volume reaches the higher tier you'll find that your unit cost becomes lower than it currently is.

Customers using v3.0 are already being charged based on our tiered structure but will now have the opportunity to received a discounted rate for certificate generated from their [verified domains](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4649879-verify-domain-ownership)!

Visit [https://activeprospect.com/pricing](https://activeprospect.com/pricing/?_gl=1*1tpu3vi*_ga*MTU1NjIxNDM1NC4xNjQyNzkzOTI2*_ga_QHXBV6N7D1*MTY5MDg5OTQ5MC4yNTUuMS4xNjkwODk5NjE2LjIuMC4w) for more details.

3. **How do I access to lead event data like IP address, originating domain, lead age, etc.?**

These data points were included for self service customers using v2.0. Now they have become part of the [TrustedForm Insights](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4709758-trustedform-insights) product. To purchase Insights [submit your information](https://activeprospect.com/pricing/#form) to be contacted by our sales team.

4. **How do I access the page scan feature?**

Page scan has also become a part of the [TrustedForm Insights](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4709758-trustedform-insights) product. To purchase Insights [submit your information](https://activeprospect.com/pricing/#form) to be contacted by our sales team.

5. **If I switch API versions mid-month how does that affect my self service pricing tier?**

When you switch API versions you will be using a new product, so your pricing tier will be reset. To avoid missing out on any lower pricing that you have qualified for we recommend switching your api-version at the beginning of the month.

6. **Does it require a different javascript snippet to record?**

No. The Certificate API does is not related to this.

# Lead Delivery using a Random Number Generator (Round Robin)

# Use Case

You want to bucket leads into two or more groups and deliver them according to various endpoints depending on what bucket the lead ends up in. This is a common workaround in LeadConduit for Round Robin and A/B split testing scenarios.

# Solution

LeadConduit appends a randomly generated number between 1 and 100 to every lead. This random number can be used for a variety of use cases, including this one.

Here you can make use of the Random Number to set **Step Criteria** on your various delivery steps to bucket the leads based on ranges of the randomly generated number.

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/305/466/original.png?f=1604429846&Expires=1748567752&Signature=dhcBpPjeVCPP3qXB255JRIAiKWsskR~r6dDGNgEobYs~ATGPVRInNVn4kNPddTuzEyWEooyjXYWaoV3lm7hReAgZiVTrie19yH8B9tKHOEz9I3u0emNaWPCtnJMiTaohisPnuZksfUHdpkqWoh14aPFmgn6SMNF9VUno0-KTf1GWpuKQXo9zA6jpSOMWJXDiSg-OnMs~hvxSWR3MdYKsTkppX3uCzW6oXF3nqZFTdPYiSYniY1GGpTmwkvsgdNtULQjXmDh7Qh8ba7~o8RMSAkKfOnanyK15aMSfxK2xNKybwaBllZ4pftBRZCe98H9JVVRyOOwPbP0JMa4nFqNIKg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

For example, for a 50/50 split, you could set the Step Criteria of the two deliveries as Less Than or Equal To 50 and Greater than 50.

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/305/468/original.png?f=1604429875&Expires=1748567752&Signature=BF36mptU4DiYu7AFdaIcn6VCfZgd6Y9jHvTm5u~ShUPhUolGJ6c04BGKQMhMpWq7hgrM8pvyKPV3ptpXMKRX-QYfpcu-CWIzodMd2OpY8VnVzU6sv3rXxg9GCGG~fbtuCf2oYIdV3Hml~8wGUK2CnDhvV-v96yH8DmwKPY1ZcSro9yOjJ1mU4X9-d2FuFRNKLx1y2U6jQMSIlT9xMGgHENyAeYwZ03ixLHNe1bxbVwCELSqCbXvXEHF6KKBlSALVvXxfAIKnhAF9qgqGHtjt9dW8cje-xDWMZ6TV~0D4ncfN8MwtUSjOEz7aMt6K9OFNYVwDxWjpTkiwRr9vjXH6Dw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

**NOTE:** This approach isn't a strict 50/50 binary split, as it is possible for any number of leads to be delivered to the first delivery endpoint in succession before a delivery to the second endpoint. However, you'll find over a given timeframe with enough lead volume, deliveries will even out very close to a 50/50 split, and for many clients, this is sufficient for their needs.

# TrustedForm API Retain Errors

While we would like to think that all data is perfect and will never display an error, we know that is not usually the case. Here we have gathered together some best practices and frequently returned errors and http codes - along with their causes - to help you identify and fix issues and get back to business.

# TrustedForm API Best Practices

Here are some best practice tips to help you proactively avoid some failures/errors when retaining (formerly known as claiming) certificates. Failures mean that a validation process was unsuccessful but the certificate was still retained. Errors mean that there was an issue that prevented the certificate from being retained and the operation should be reviewed and retried. If you have any other tips let us know by sending your suggestions by [reaching out our Support](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5116014-how-to-contact-activeprospect-support) and we'll be happy to share them here!

- **Automate the process of retaining**. Less manual work also means less likelihood of user error... and automation gives you time back in your day! (Using a TrustedForm retain/claim step in a LeadConduit flow to retain certificates is automated retaining.)
- **Take action on your certificates within the retain window**. Attempting to retain a certificate after the window has closed will lead to an error (multiple codes, such as 404 and 410 below, deal with expired items).
- Permanently store the full TrustedForm Certificate URL in your system along with the lead's contact data. The Certificate URL is the only means by which a retained certificate can be retrieved in the event of a consumer complaint.
- **Monitor your retained certificates for errors regularly**. You can't fix what you don't know is broken, and most errors are easier to fix the sooner you see them.
- **Maintain a process that logs every retain** and saves the data in the response to the retain request so that, if you encounter an issue, you have some way of looking back over what happened. (Retaining Certificates using a TrustedForm retain/claim step in a LeadConduit flow makes this information available for up to 3 months, the limit that LeadConduit holds flow data.)

#### Common Failures seen that still result in retention of the certificate

Successful TrustedForm retain operations can result in failures that provide information.

- ""None of the provided fingerprints match” - the TrustedForm certificate was retained, but [neither the submitted phone number or submitted email match what's on the certificate](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4766190-trustedform-fingerprint-lead-matching). These email and phone parameters, if they are included on a request, are not required to match what was captured from the web session, but it's a good idea to make sure those match to ensure you're claiming high-quality leads.
- ""Required scan text not found"" - this error means that the TrustedForm certificate was retained but TrustedForm did not find the [required scan text](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4078890-trustedform-page-scan) that was specified in the request.

# Error HTTP Codes and Their Definitions

- **0**: This is a client side error, which means it would be something you would need to look into on your side. For example, it could mean a network issue on your side or a client side timeout (ex: If you have the timeout set to 5 seconds and TrustedForm takes more than 5 seconds, it could be an HTTP 0). Please correct and retry the retain.
- **201**: Success! This code is _not_ an error. If you successfully retain a certificate, ""HTTP 201 Created"" will be returned with the JSON representation of the values included in the certificate in the response's body.
- **400**: If the certificate id is formatted incorrectly, ""HTTP 400 Bad Request"" or ""HTTP 406 Not Acceptable"" will be returned as the server cannot process the request because of the incorrect formatting. Please correct and retry the retain.
- **402**: Usually an issue with account payment or service subscription causes ""HTTP 402 Payment Required"". Please correct and retry the retain.
- **403**: If you have not authenticated correctly using your API key, ""HTTP 403 Forbidden"" will be returned. Please correct and retry the retain.
- **404**: If the certificate is older than 3 days or if the certificate URL is invalid, then ""HTTP 404 Not Found"" will be returned. Please correct and retry the retain. NOTE: These can be retried and may succeed for a very, very small number of certificates, but the usual case is that the retry is not successful.
- **405**: Method not allowed. This occurs when you are trying to retain a certificate produced in Sandbox mode.
- **406**: If the certificate id is formatted incorrectly, ""HTTP 400 Bad Request"" or ""HTTP 406 Not Acceptable"" will be returned as the server cannot process the request because of the incorrect formatting. Please correct and retry the retain.
- **410**: If the certificate has expired and is pending deletion because of age after creation, you will receive ""HTTP 410 Gone"". Do not retry.
- **500, 502, 503**: If you receive ""HTTP 500 Internal Server Error"", ""HTTP 502 Bad Gateway"", or ""HTTP 503 Service Unavailable"", please retry the retain.
- **Timeouts**: Please retry the retain.

# Logging and Support

Customers must maintain their own logs of requests made to the TrustedForm API. ActiveProspect does not maintain logs of API requests, and ActiveProspect Support cannot ""look up"" API requests to provide diagnostic assistance.

If your requests to the TrustedForm API are failing and if you can provide us with the raw Http request and the raw Http response returned, ActiveProspect Support may be able to identify the nature of a malformed request. ActiveProspect Support generally cannot instruct you in how to configure your application to make an API request.

# SuppressionList + LeadConduit Use Cases

Common use cases and best practices for SuppressionList + LeadConduit.

Duplicate Checking Method 1: Query, Filter, Add to a List when the lead is accepted.

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/426/464/original.png?f=1608675113&Expires=1748567764&Signature=uUSp53Fx4u-l4XY6rckp8mkeECxwfevPynudezA6c6ss48CBtEKgUFe2AuX3mUx5Zrqh6f3o0XYefFXfbmU1RU1qBbX~UM7OKZ4lUArFNkKeKdMCxK5dK8qQwRwldXlhr48JC-ZfB50gzGXbhKz~LXREXd15CtWzKwvYbJGj5M013nMJT~XOZnY7PHdqEp5fTyIYadTI95pbXE250wVQ51aNt4onAJVwWbqJJ7pVVsPLjO99Anh4wzT~kZ2fUeglWHFSk4IWVXKjQGLfh1WaaeuQXL1ojkYqxQoW7IJSWSOH6wCPj4HnQFbrnc4AQB3MhSCeD5TJvs2-rXvAqBoS0A__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

This is the default method of using SuppressionList. It's the simplest to set up and requires a only three flow steps: A SuppressionList **Query** step, a **Filter** step to act on the outcome of that query and, when duplicate-checking, a SuppressionList **Add to List** step to update the list with the new lead's key value.

Duplicate Checking Method 2: Add to a List then Remove if the lead is not accepted.

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/607/226/original.png?f=1616429089&Expires=1748567764&Signature=EYDYXjlJYIVKvnPGAYbWa2NagsDOJ083Fv3ajOZPROWjY4VkxWAKI5rCTsmu3sPQ63f1CvdMGKRHLRRGKnSZrwotgxNyaO9DLFgs4YZOxbd5fUGulh7iCJtoy9qYgck-SZqEC7YwmfZTeRe3xkke0bWF--oP5dsoMfP3v4UyeIaQgM0kY80Y7C~oeM9JP31LWTOy1rL14v5xuU3Tji-JHZgtgMNTk-6LfxwZ63qF28n1shEI1t0VuuBRazQwJ0GwOqH8osu-SKMaCv0vToKT1MhECxF89A1SLcXaYSqObGhiOR~drwPcaObWgYb7F-I2ibYmR-T3EqUNL5nA5DqZYg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

The Query & Add Item step is effective at catching a rapid-fire ""stutter"" of duplicate lead submissions, and is especially useful in flows that take a long time to process each lead.

The ""Query and Add"" SuppressionList step first adds the key field to the list, then immediately checks to see if that value is unique within the list. If not, then it was already in the list, can be considered a duplicate, and an ""is Unique"" datum of ""false"" will be appended to the lead. A Filter step can then reject the lead based on the value of ""Is Unique"".

If ""Is Unique"" is true, then the key value is new to the list and the lead is not a duplicate. No further action is necessary unless a subsequent Filter rejects the lead. In that case, you'll want to delete the new key value from the list so as not to treat future leads to dupe out. You'd do this by placing a SuppressionList ""Delete Item"" step just before each subsequent filter, with step rules to limit it's execution to the same conditions that would cause the associated filter to reject the lead.

Because of the possible need for multiple ""Delete Item"" steps with step rules, this method is more complex to set up and maintain. But it's very effective at trapping rapid-fire duplicate submissions.

Best Practice is to use Query - Filter - Add by default, reserving Query & Add - filter - Delete for cases where the default method has proven inadequate.

**Rapid-Fire Submission Deduping: Combining duplicate checking methods 1 and 2 for with a short-term, self-pruning list.**

Occasionally with method 1 above, sources will submit duplicate leads to a flow before the original version of the lead has had time to reach the ""Add to list"" step near the end of the flow. While method 2 is effective at catching these, it also requires SuppressionList ""delete item"" steps mated to each and every post-query filter in the flow. Here's an effective way to achieve ""rapid-fire"" deduping while keeping most of the simplicity of method 1 deduping.

First, set up duplicate checking as described in level 1 above.

Next, create a new, ""rapid-fire"" list in SuppressionList, but set its ""Automatic List Pruning"" property to 1 minute.

![](https://content0.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/300/098/original.png?f=1657739176&Expires=1748567764&Signature=r-tZM5WiKPy6DYwiddTR6ApHLAwo8VHPjOofK5eDeCStTeXi8D6o~0VU8V8OhBZj1qderB1ayKKFB2mirZfGCus9lpYfrl6umpHWKVY2eNBi27EdeW3AT81mHlF3gyu34AGfG~-~gW2mQ1V9YA69mUMA4mGdvMrEyOXMMYKXnILjmwTupf~ZSxEo026UWagi~t3nmMAIreccjgIG0VFTAJoF5f2U0sy0vcJWcK2iCk1cEnW10d63LzF0bbgwOP0Z-4tSQ~x139WMRmgbJM9onKRvgOLnYNzkbNKMmxt-ucVX4WlXcjMT5NZP6dT0UFooTHjrTh-dkhhZlydkzYxN~A__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Finally, at the top of your flow,  add an ""Is unique"" query step to check the rapid-fire list, with a filter as described in method 2 above. You don't need to include any of Method 2's ""Delete item"" steps at all, since the rapid-fire list will automatically clear any new items after 1 minute.

How this works:

- When a lead enters your flow, the ""Is Unique"" step attempts to add the query item to the rapid-fire list.
- If the item was already in that list the new, duplicate lead will immediately be stopped and rejected by a filter.
- If the lead is a duplicate of a successful one submitted more than a minute ago, the Method 1 query and its filter will reject the lead.
-  If the lead is not a duplicate per either method, the item value will, at the bottom of the flow, be added to the long-term list.
- Duplicate or not, the item value will automatically be deleted from the rapid-fire list 1 minute after the ""Is Unique"" step executes.

Use Cases Other Than Duplicate Checking

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/002/426/465/original.png?f=1608675132&Expires=1748567764&Signature=UT0gEQcqZ1xu10iSGiARySHBXHmC52z1apQAKjhZczKXhY1I~P4DSHYkwCNpDW71nY28L6v7S127xkmsaBHHVrWJltAoqyJi6v0t2hmFJwbYvmCvOFESBwQ58GQq-w3Dlpz33ZDvk5Pf2ANtrGMNGzkQUQPqqqTWQqtBhhjHjOOx2RwVDpqghkSoE2R4PdUtrkt8SUTVKSsnfNSWSxOXSR33wCAvKvLfAGSy5slmj2NYYUY00hTTeRFNU8qNIdqRr~2710MduIXWfGSVBFH~oUnH53bjIUcFJxDrc4KKir0yyyO7Kdns20307phYzJWxEn2r3d7U-IQezHpUW0Ax-g__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Sometimes your flow will query lists for reasons other than deduplication, like an existing-customer list, an area code whitelist, your internal do-not-call blacklist, or your own known litigators' list. In those cases an ""Add-to"" step is not needed. You can manually add new entries or replace the entire content of a list by importing the new key values in a csv file. This process is accessible in your account's SuppressionList dashboard.

# Best Practice For Filter Placement

When referencing SuppressionList step outcomes, a Filter will always see only the appended data from the most-recently-executed Query step. For instance, If your flow has two or more Suppression list Query steps, a filter located after (below) those steps will only be able to evaluate the ""Query Item Found"" value appended by the step that last executed a query.

Note that If a Query step in such a Flow doesn't execute (Outcome is ""skip"") the ""Query Item Found"" value will be that of the last Query step that DID execute, since the skipped step had no ""Query Item Found"" value to overwrite the previous result.

Obviously this can get complicated, so Best Practice is to always locate a filter immediately after the Query step it's evaluating, and if the Query step is subject to step rules, take that into account in your Filter's rules.

**What about Capitalization and Punctuation?**

SuppressionList lowercases capitalized letters in a value before storing or querying it, so ""Ted"" and ""ted"" would be seen as the same value in a query. What SuppressionList does not do is remove white space or punctuation to standardize against the possibility of variations in those characteristics. So ""John O'Hara"" and ""John Ohara"" would be treated as different values because of the apostrophe.

# TrustedForm Session Replay Enhancements

Now it's easier to find the exact moments that matter!

The session replay shown in TrustedForm certificates is the best tool you have to understand the experience a user had while interacting with a web page hosting the TrustedForm script. A recreation of that experience is built using a copy of the web page and a detailed log of all the events that occurred during the user's visit. That recreation is shown in the Session Replay tab of TrustedForm certificates and now includes enhancements to highlight the most pertinent events and allow you to quickly jump to any of them. Use these tip to efficiently find points of interests and see the events you care about.

1\. Hover over events in the timeline to see what happened

![](https://content3.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/003/329/838/original.png?f=1659483593&Expires=1748567782&Signature=BtE5zz2p1fZaP4O5ZNMn3Qw7f0L71ZeWZ272ooq~FGfsAXse-Y7lc44P2a~ntrrj02TxCuiIGbkAnp4vMDM3LDdQLLYW3NfwqGvtelaM0b7Wnw2XPRj1-dNTx2SokrvF75pFzfyhG98AF39StPsUfMEIP73LgxRvt~V6LRNF8sNtYBopdhTzx2fgwKghA6invEIqerTFXjzUxPJddXD06aisIBV1kJeWo3N5JXODRyMacvXDdp5LOa5tZffA9dzXyIymzRqnGRetocnTKRB0Ao-24T2mYN8Hqu~4y5~pn5g-2d7HwbRcBP232yb2Z3AhLZ29~bAVZy1Xu3Scbu5Adg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

#### Frequently Asked Questions

- **Which TrustedForm product do I need to use this feature?**

These session replay enhancements are available to all accounts that have TrustedForm's ""Claim"", ""Consent"" or ""Retain"" product.
- **Will these enhancements be added to my earlier certificates?**

No, these enhancements are only available for certificates created after it released. Previously existing certificates have already been archived using previous versions of the session replay. In order to maintain the integrity of TrustedForm certificates we do not push updates to existing certificates.
- **Why is one of the events green?**

The final form submission event is colored green to highlight when the consumer submitted the form as this is often the most important event when determining if consent was provided.

# I can't see xxTrustedFormCertUrl when running the TrustedForm javascript on my web site

xxTrustedFormCertUrl is the TrustedForm Certificate URL created on your web site when the TrustedForm script runs. But what if you can't see it added to the HTML/DOM?

xxTrustedFormCertUrl is the hidden field containing the TrustedForm Certificate URL created when the [TrustedForm javascript](https://app.trustedform.com/certificates/issue?__hstc=41051389.726c4dc26e7785799c707366773e8b36.1748564173062.1748564173062.1748564173062.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564173063&__hsfp=3707738794) runs on your web site. If you cannot see it being created in your site, you may want to use the callback function provided by ActiveProspect. This function returns its value.

For an example and  more information, please see these articles:

# Can I implement TrustedForm with dynamic forms?

Yes! Our Certificate contains a copy of the HTML as seen by the consumer when the script is added to the page. That HTML is visible by anyone with access to the certificate. Even if you have a dynamic form, you'll be able to provide the advertiser with assurance that you are representing their offer correctly.

# Facebook Lead Ads Troubleshooting: Try this first.

If your Facebook Lead Ads are not reaching LeadConduit, try this first. This process confirms and reauthorizes the flow's Facebook integration.

To collect and process Facebook Lead Ads, LeadConduit's authorization to collect leads from your Facebook pages must be up-to-date. When there is a change in Facebook administrative access, which occurs even when no action is taken by the Facebook admin user, or it the Facebook password for the user who initially connected LeadConduit changes, you may need to reauthorize the connected pages. This document describes how to do this.

**A. Disconnect  your Facebook Pages from the flow.**

1. Edit the flow, click on the Sources tab, and click Add Source. Note: Don't remove the existing Facebook Lead Ads source from your LeadConduit flow. What you're doing here will just temporarily disconnect your Facebook pages from the flow. You'll reconnect them in the part B.
2. Search for and click on Facebook Lead Ads Routed Inbound.
3. Authenticate if not already logged into your Facebook page.
4. Disconnect all pages connected to this flow by clicking off the pages.
5. Click Continue and Finish.
6. Save the flow at top right.

**Optionally (Try this after ""A"" as a second resort):**

You can optionally also disconnect your Facebook Pages from the Facebook Account side. This is something to try after performing ""A"", if steps A and B performed alone do not successfully start the leads flowing again.

1. Go to your [Profile Settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings) on Facebook.
2. Click **Business Integrations** in the left menu.
3. In the **Business Integrations** section, select the **Active** tab.
4. Find the LeadConduit integration you need to remove in the list that appears or use the search.
5. Select the box next to LeadConduit and click **Remove**.
6. To confirm you want to remove it, click **Remove**.

**B. Reconnect  your Facebook Pages to the flow.**

1. Repeating the process above, edit the flow, click the Sources tab and click Add Source; search/click Facebook Lead Ads Routed Inbound.
2. Connect pages that need to be connected to this flow by clicking them one by one.
3. Click Continue and Finish.
4. Save the flow at top right.
5. Send a test lead from https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing/ to test that the page is now sending in leads.
6. Your mappings should be intact after this operation and you should see new Facebook leads coming in.
7. If Facebook leads are still not showing up in the flow, check all of the permissions as described in the article "" [Setting Up Facebook Lead Ads](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4062063-setting-up-facebook-lead-ads)"".

# Why aren’t leads synced in real-time from Facebook Lead Ads to my CRM?

If you are experiencing an issue retrieving leads in real-time from Facebook, you may need to make sure you granted to LeadsBridge the Lead Access permission from your [Facebook Business Manager.](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/442345745885606?id=180505742745347)

The Business Manager is a Facebook tool designed to improve assets management: with this tool, you’ll be able to manage your Pages, Ad Accounts, Apps, Partners, etc., giving specific Asset permissions to Users and Partners.

As a result of this management, if permissions are not properly configured, you could encounter one of the following situations:

- You are not able to fetch any lead when opening the Leads Table of your bridge.

- You’re only able to see the test leads sent from your Facebook account.

- You’re able to see the leads, but they are not being automatically synchronized in real-time by LeadsBridge


If one of the above-mentioned situations arises, the following guidelines will help you set the correct permissions inside Business Manager. Be sure to follow the step-by-step instructions carefully.

### **Do you have access to a Business Manager?**

**NO** → You should contact the Owner/Admin of the Business Manager that owns the Page you want to connect with LeadsBridge and ask them to follow the steps below on your behalf.

**YES** → Log into the Business Manager and go to [Business Settings](https://business.facebook.com/settings/).

### **Can you see Integrations » Leads Access on the left side of the screen?**

**NO** → You should contact the Owner/Admin of the Business Manager that owns the Page you want to connect with LeadsBridge and ask them to follow the steps below on your behalf.

**YES** → This means that you are the Owner/Admin of the Business Manager.

### **Once you’re inside the Business Manager and you know you’re the Owner/Admin**

1. Go to **Accounts » Pages**. Do you want to give access to a User or a Partner?

1. **USER**

      1. Go to Users » People

      2. Click on the User name

      3. Make sure that the BM User has a role (ADS, LEADS, CONTENT: Create, Manage or Moderate) inside the Facebook Page
2. **PARTNER**

      1. Go to Users » Partners

      2. Click on the Partner name

      3. Make sure that the Business Manager Partner has a role inside the Facebook Page

1. Go to **Integrations » Leads Access**

1. HELP! I can’t see “Integrations » Leads Access” This means that you’re not a Business Manager Owner/Admin → Go back to the beginning of the guide

2. Click on the Page

3. Do you want to give access to a User or a Partner?

      - **USER** → Make sure the User has been added to the People section, otherwise add it using the Assign People button

      - **PARTNER** → Make sure the User has been added to the Partners section, otherwise, add it using the Assign Partners button.

      1. **YES** → GREAT! Everything has been set up correctly!

      2. **NO** → Click on Assign CRMs, is LeadsBridge listed under Add CRMs and Set Permissions?

         1. **NO** → Log into your LeadsBridge application and Publish a bridge connecting the Page you’re working with

# How do I send a test lead from Facebook?

You can follow these steps to send a test lead with real data from Facebook:

1. Click here: [https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/lead-ads-testing)
2. Choose the Facebook Page where you want to insert the test lead
3. Click on the **Delete lead** button in case you've already submitted a lead from your Facebook account on this form. In fact, leads can only be submitted once to a particular form
4. Click on the **Preview form** (do not click on **Create lead** button, as this will send the test lead with the _[test@fb.com](mailto:test@fb.com)_ email address)
5.  Insert any valid email and data
6.  Click on **Submit**

If you are **an Admin/Owner** of the Page and have all Facebook Business Manager Permissions, including the LeadsBridge app as a CRM, attached to that Page, you will see the following response from Facebook:

![](https://content1.bloomfire.com/thumbnails/contents/004/477/110/original.png?f=1725970698&Expires=1748567764&Signature=D6MgqmVku3gMplFuiGX0qTI8P5qdhXuK8ROQQ3PRzIu2KAMhMqYzBiXYeTiS0SYWCRA39z5otg28s9j5R8Nf6YLTvTixIhaI-E6zw~uW5OwBtYUsMHlnyil~3aJehwpeaoGXbipPPCTKMFO7TvsQY9yI4hGgcD8b~4vM2pG7XK4qFyYwiY4gGU2~rg-oCG3T3VgtwhpbtlS7WvQme1e1c3utcggD1XCsZdYznf-a1EDFGLu0gXwqY9uH4pvNmvwHjOSvL9ly9xrwqCpaV72T8wnDGUBbnVpRT1EYjwl-jRSn6y7Thv5qEJjbMsr2KFyhLSdZEcYb0SVL2dpngkDLJg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIDFCFZ2UHE5LPIUA)

Once done, the test leads will appear in LeadsBridge and in your CRM/Autoresponder.

## Important notes:

1. Test leads are counted as organic leads and won’t be associated with an Ad.
2. You are allowed to send one test lead per Form. To test more than once, click on Delete Lead first to remove the previous test. This action will only delete the test lead created from Facebook.
3. The [test@fb.com](mailto:test@fb.com) is a fake lead that won’t be recognized by lots of CRM/Autoresponders. In this case, we suggest sending a test lead using real information.
4. If you get the **_103 error: CRM access has been revoked from Lead Access Manager -_** it means that you need to grant LeadsBridge correct permissions to access your Facebook leads. Please consult our community article on [how to enable the right Facebook permissions](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5070199-why-aren-t-leads-synced-in-real-time-from-facebook-lead-ads-to-my-crm).

# Do I have to implement TrustedForm multiple times for multiple offers on the same page?

No. You can just implement the script once per page (no matter how many offers are on the page). If the consumer signs up for multiple offers you can pass the same certificate for every offer.
