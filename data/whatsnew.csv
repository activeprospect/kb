### [New in TrustedForm Verify: Enhanced Compliance Checks](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/new-in-trustedform-verify-enhanced-compliance-checks)

Programmatically validate font size, contrast ratio, and opt-in method, before contacting a lead.

We’ve added three new automated checks to TrustedForm Verify, to help lead buyers enforce consent standards with confidence.

These checks support compliance with the 'clear and conspicuous' consent requirements under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and related standards.

Here’s what each check does:

- **Font Size Check** – Verifies that the consent language shown to each lead meets a minimum font size, ensuring it’s easy to read. [Learn more](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5561944-coming-soon-trustedform-verify-font-size-check)

- **Contrast Ratio Check** – Confirms that consent text stands out clearly against its background for better visibility. [Learn more](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5561943-coming-soon-trustedform-verify-contrast-ratio-check)

- **Opt-in Type Check** – Verifies that each lead opted in using an allowed method, helping you enforce your consent standards. [Learn more](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5619028-coming-soon-trustedform-verify-opt-in-type-check)


These safeguards help protect your brand, reduce regulatory exposure, and improve lead quality. TrustedForm Verify now lets you apply these standards automatically, helping reduce legal risk and ensure every lead meets your compliance criteria before contact.

**Add Enhanced Compliance Checks to your [TrustedForm Verify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/verify/) process today.**

### [New LeadConduit Feature Released: Buyer Step & Free Buyer Accounts](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/new-leadconduit-feature-released-buyer-step-free-buyer-accounts-gVHbFs1L)

The Buyer Step allows a paid LeadConduit user to deliver leads to their buyer without having to configure a delivery to the buyers CRM. They simply add a Buyer Step in their flow and can either have it deliver to a partner they have already connected with or invite a new Buyer.

- If the Buyer does not have an account with ActiveProspect or has an account but does not have a subscription to LeadConduit, they will be prompted to create one and configure a delivery to their own CRM. This account is free but does not allow them to filter and reject leads.
- If the Buyer has a paid subscription to LeadConduit, they will be asked which flow they want to add this new source to so they can receive leads from their seller.

### [One-Click Subdomain Registration is Here!](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/one_click-subdomain-registration-is-here-zLSFcmlg)

Managing domains in TrustedForm just got faster and more intuitive.

### ![✅](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/2705.png)**Register All Subdomains Automatically**

You can now register **all subdomains** with a single checkbox when adding a new domain. No more repetitive manual entries—just check “Register all subdomains” and you’re done.

> ![⚠️](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/26a0.png) Heads-up: If there are subdomains you **don’t** want to register, you’ll need to add each one manually instead.

### ![💡](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/1f4a1.png) Get Started in Seconds:

- Go to **Domain Settings**

- Add a domain

- Check **“Register all subdomains”**

### ![👀](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/1f440.png) ICYMI: **Unowned Certificates Now Highlighted**

### [New Tools to Identify Risky Lead Sources in TrustedForm](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/new-tools-to-identify-risky-lead-sources-in-trustedform-Qb0qzxiQ)

We’ve launched new updates in our TrustedForm app to help you identify leads from unverified domains, a key risk for compliance and lead quality. In the Home tab, you’ll now see three new charts showing the breakdown of retained certificates across confirmed vs. unconfirmed domains, the percentage of unverified sources, and a vendor list.

In the Retain tab, any new certificates from unverified domains will now include a clear warning icon. These updates apply only to new certificates moving forward.

**Why This Matters**
Buying leads from anonymous sources puts your business at serious risk. If a lead generator hasn’t confirmed domain ownership, they can’t be held accountable, and that opens the door to regulatory violations, fraud, and low-quality leads.

![✅](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/2705.png)**Compliance:** When domain ownership is confirmed, we can alert sources about potential TCPA issues and help all parties stay compliant.
![🛡](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/1f6e1.png)️ **Fraud prevention:** Bad actors hide behind anonymity. If a domain isn’t verified, you have no way of knowing who’s behind the lead.
![🔎](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/1f50e.png)**Trust:** Your legal and compliance teams need transparency. If a vendor can’t (or won’t) confirm their domains, it raises serious concerns about credibility.

**What You Should Do Now** If you're buying leads from unconfirmed domains, it’s time to act. Ask your vendors to confirm all domains used to generate your leads in ActiveProspect. This process gives you the transparency needed to protect your business.

We’ve created a vendor outreach email template to make it easy to get started.

### [Share URLs: Now Easier to Access!](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/share-urls-now-easier-to-access)

We’ve made it easier to access Share URLs. Previously, Share URLs were hidden in the Certificate History tab, making them hard to find. To improve accessibility, the Share button has now been moved to the certificate header, making it quicker and simpler to share your certificates. This change will only apply to **new certificates** moving forward and will not be retroactively applied to existing ones.

**Share URLs** allow customers to share certificates with other parties without requiring authentication. This feature is often used when sharing certificates in the event of a complaint or litigation, allowing legal teams, judges, or other parties who may not be members of the customer’s account to view the certificate.

Please note that Share URLs are openly viewable by any party that receives them. As such, they should be used cautiously and in accordance with best practices for sharing.

Learn more about [How to share TrustedForm certificates](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5139455-how-do-you-share-a-trustedform-certificate) in our updated community post.

### [TrueCall Integration on TrustedForm Certificates](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/truecall-integration-on-trustedform-certificates-X7fBnA6f)

We’re excited to announce a new integration that enhances the transparency and validation of your inbound calls. TrustedForm now supports the inclusion of **TrueCall IDs** in TrustedForm certificates, helping you easily verify the legitimacy of the calls you're receiving.

By clicking on the TrueCall ID, you’ll be redirected to the TrueCall platform where you can view detailed information about the call and confirm whether it was genuinely initiated by a potential customer.

TrueCall helps eliminate the risk of unauthorized outbound calls infiltrating inbound marketing campaigns, giving you more confidence in the quality of your leads.

### [Improved Management of Unreviewed Consent Languages](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/improved-management-of-unreviewed-consent-languages-OyGM3heK)

The [Consent Language Manager](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474006-trustedform-consent-language-manager) under TrustedForm Verify helps you track and manage variations of consent language shown to your leads. New variations appear in the Unreviewed tab, where you can approve or reject them for future use.

To help you better manage consent language variations, we’re updating how newly autogenerated unreviewed templates are created. Going forward, phone numbers and email addresses will be replaced with placeholders instead of actual values, with **{{phone}}** for phone numbers and **{{email}}** for email addresses.

This change prevents unnecessary template duplication due to minor variations, making it easier to review and manage consent languages efficiently.

You can use these placeholders along with wildcards when creating approved consent language templates to group similar variations together and reduce clutter. For more details on how to use placeholders and wildcards effectively, check out our updated [community post](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5448162-manually-add-approved-language-to-trustedform-verify-consent-language-manager).

As a reminder, there is a limit of 1,000 unreviewed consent language templates. Be sure to review and approve or reject them regularly to keep your list manageable.

New variations appear in the _Unreviewed_ tab, where you can decide to approve or reject them for future use.

We’ve noticed that for some customers, this section can grow too large, which may affect the performance of certain features. To address this, we’re introducing a limit of 1,000 consent languages in the _Unreviewed_ tab. Once this limit is reached, new variations will stop populating until the existing ones are reviewed.

If you hit this limit, be sure to review your consent languages to make room. You can also use wildcards to group similar languages together and reduce clutter. We're working on additional updates to make the review process even smoother—stay tuned!

### [TrustedForm Verify](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/trustedform-new-ui-update-fPrJQyB8)

Today we introduce the newest product offering in the TrustedForm family!

Verify gives you the tools you need to assure yourself that leads you have purchased have given meaningful consent to be contacted. Purchased leads often originate from hundreds or even thousands of different sources. As a marketer it is your job to make sure you only reach out to leads that were generated in a compliant manner to protect your business from unnecessary violations, litigation and poor consumer experiences that hurt your reputation.

![Image #1](https://app.getbeamer.com/pictures?id=361614-Y--_vVQl77-9bAZB77-977-977-977-977-9RHvvv70scDLvv73vv70yAA8Y77-977-9J23vv73vv73vv70.&v=4)

When you view the Verify section of the TrustedForm application you will be taken to your Consent Language Manager. Here you will see all the different variations of consent languages used to generate the leads you purchased. Have your compliance team review them and approve all the ones that meet their requirements while rejecting the ones that don’t. Then simply use the verify operation within the TrustedForm Certificate API for all the new leads you plan to purchase and the result will tell you whether you should accept it or not.

Expand your compliance assessment and make sure you only purchase leads with meaningful consent using TrustedForm Verify!

In order to further support that, TrustedForm certificates now hide all form input data by default until [the certificate has been matched with lead data](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4766190-trustedform-lead-matching) to ensure that PII and other sensitive information is only made available to parties that already have access to it.

This change highlights the importance and encourages the best practice of lead matching to protect everyone involved in the lead generation process against mistake or bad actors. It also makes TrustedForm certificates suitable for ping/post lead distribution so that they can be passed to potential buyers to gain more information about the lead event without exposing information that can be used to contact or identify the lead. For lead publishers/vendors this means your process just became easier as you don't have to pass a different URL on the ping anymore!

If you view a TrustedForm certificate and are prompted to [perform lead matching](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5021187-lead-matching-when-viewing-a-trustedform-certificate), simply enter the email or phone number input during the lead event and the form input values will be revealed to you the same as they have always been. Make sure to automate this process in the your flows by perform lead matching in your API requests when you store certificates. If you run into any issues contact our support team and they will be happy to help.

Check the [Stored Certificate by Match Status card on the TrustedForm Dashboard](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4932869-stored-certificates-by-match-status-on-the-trustedform-dashboard).

### [Introducing TrustedForm Certificate API v4.0](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/introducing-trustedform-certificate-api-v40)

TrustedForm Certificate API v4.0 is the latest and recommended version when using the TrustedForm product offering. It offers a more organized request & response structure that is extensible to accommodate new products in the future. It also offers discounted pricing for storing certificates you generated and protection against making duplicate requests. [Learn more](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5066720-introducing-trustedform-certificate-api-v4-0)

As part of this version upgrade, TrustedForm Consent has been replaced with TrustedForm Retain. Retain is our newest product that is streamlined for retaining certificates and has a name to match. It is important to remember that having a TrustedForm certificate is not the same as having prior express written consent. You must examine how your leads are being generated to ensure that consent is properly obtained during the process. For this reason, Retain is more appropriate product name.

Self-service customers should read [TrustedForm Self Service: How to use API version 4.0](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5098113-trustedform-self-service-how-to-use-api-version-4-0) for instructions to use the new version.

Managed customers should wait for your customer success manager to reach out to you about upgrading.

### [New data security enhancement limiting access to TrustedForm Certificate session replays](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/stored-certificates-by-match-status-on-the-trustedform-dashboard)

Beginning July 5, 2023, new TrustedForm certificates will, by default, hide all form input data in session replays to protect against any possible unauthorized access of the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of consumers. Note: All TrustedForm Certificates created prior to this update will have no change.

With this change, the full session replays (with form inputs) will only be viewable by users who have demonstrated that they already have access to the PII in the session replay. This enhancement ensures that consumer data cannot be accessed through the TrustedForm Certificate by any party who doesn’t already have access to the consumer data. This new data protection is achieved without compromising the current session replay functionality of TrustedForm.

### [Validate TrustedForm Cert URL in LeadConduit Rulesets!](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/validate-trustedform-cert-url-in-leadconduit-rulesets)

Our customers frequently ask for a way to quickly and easily validate that a TrustedForm certificate URL is real and not expired. And we’ve listened. LeadConduit can now inspect and validate all TrustedForm certificates instantaneously in any ruleset in LeadConduit. That means that a lead submitted with a TrustedForm certificate URL that is fabricated or points to an expired certificate can now be rejected immediately before the lead is processed.

Simply add a rule to your acceptance criteria to check that the format is valid, and LeadConduit will perform an instant deep analysis on the certificate URL, without any cost to you.

Find out what else you can do with this new field type in the community article linked below!

### [New Consent Language Detection!](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/new-consent-language-detection)

If you are using the TrustedForm Consent product and the TrustedForm Web Script finds consent language on a web page, the certificate that is created will have a section titled ""Consent Language Detected"". This section contains text that was identified as consent language by our proprietary machine learning model. Use this to become more aware of what your leads are consenting to and get new variations approved by your legal team to remain compliant with regulations like the TCPA.

Based on a bunch of feedback from our clients, we've introduced a new option for how dates are formatted during event exports. This new ""yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss"" format is recognized as a ""date/time"" object by spreadsheet applications, allowing you to easily reformat the date into whatever format you need - whether you need just the year for someone's age, just need the date and not the time, etc.

This new format is now the default, but you can deselect the toggle to use the older format.

**Our SuppressionList in Enhanced Real-time Bidding capability has been updated to provide you more control over how you check your lists!**

Now, if you want to disregard more recent matches, you can optionally set a ""lookback period"". For example, if you'd like to only consider a record a ""duplicate"" if they were added within the last 30 days, you'd select ""30"", and ""Days"" as shown in the documentation linked below.

Note that this works _independently_ of SuppressionList's ""auto pruning"" functionality, allowing you to fine-tune your checks without compromising the integrity of your lists.

LeadConduit now supports either TrustedForm Ping URLs or full TrustedForm Cert URLs when used with TrustedForm Data in Real-time Bidding. Previously, only TrustedForm Cert URLs were supported.

LeadConduit's Ping system is already designed such that buyers cannot extract any information about the lead from the Ping - whether it's PII passed as a field, the Cert URL, etc. However, this capability has been implemented to provide better ease of use and to give vendors more confidence in providing TrustedForm information on the Ping.

## We have introduced a new capability: using SuppressionList queries in acceptance criteria and pricing to give greater control over your Real-time Bidding!    This addition to Real-time Bidding allows you to leverage SuppressionList to make decisions about whether you want to accept a lead, or change your bid on a lead.     Adding SuppressionList to be used within Acceptance Criteria, Volume Caps and Pricing will allow you to…    \- Reject leads earlier in the process, providing better, more instantaneous feedback to Sellers while minimizing spend on processing leads you don’t want     \- Protect yourself from litigation by not bidding on leads that have already asked to not be contacted    \- Bid more aggressively on leads you perceive to be of higher value    \- Bid less aggressively on leads you perceive to be of lower value    Your account must be enabled for Real-time Bidding and using SuppressionList to use this feature on the Ping.

### [TrustedForm API Consent Failure Outcome](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/trustedform-api-consent-failure-outcome)

TrustedForm API users with a subscription that includes Consent features are now able to take advantage of the outcome field to do more than tell whether or not a claim was successful. The API also considers factors that affect your ability to verify that consumer has given expressed written consent to be contacted. Currently this will cause the outcome field to respond as ""failure"" if none of the provided fingerprints match, forbidden scan terms ware found or required scan terms were missing. In the future we plan to consider additional factors to increase your confidence that consent was provided. If you want to ensure that your lead has consent be sure to review or filter out leads when the outcome is failure.

\-\-\-

As such the description of the outcome field has been updated to the following:
""The result of the attempt to verify consent. Success indicates that the certificate was claimed and did not generate any warnings related to consent verification. Failure indicates that the certificate was claimed but generated warnings because no fingerprints matched, forbidden scan terms ware found or required scan terms were missing. Error indicates that the certificate was not claimed and the request should be reviewed and potentially retried.""

### [Two Factor Authentication Now Available](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/two-factor-authentication-now-available)

Step-up your ActiveProspect account security with Two Factor Authentication (2FA).

You are probably familiar with 2FA. 2FA is an extra layer of security used to ensure when you are logging into your ActiveProspect account, you are who you say you are. Serving as a validation tool, 2FA works to provide your ActiveProspect account the security you need. First, a user will enter their username and a password. Then, instead of immediately gaining account access, they will be required to provide a custom code received in a text message.

Go to your user account settings to enable for yourself or make a request to Support@ActiveProspect.com to enable for all users on your Account.

[How to Enable 2FA](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4579643-two-factor-authentication)

### [Data Capture for Android Users of TrustedForm](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/data-capture-for-android-users-of-trustedform)

This morning we detected a sudden issue preventing TrustedForm certificates from being generated for consumers using an Android operating system. Since then the issue has been resolved and have found the root cause to be a change made by Amazon Web Services (AWS), our cloud services provider, to a security feature meant to block malicious database attacks. The impact of this change prevented the creation of TrustedForm Certificates by Android users from approximately 08:00 - 15:55 UTC.

To mitigate incidents like this from happening in the future we are adding monitors to alert us of anomalous changes in our firewall traffic. If you have any questions regarding yesterday’s outage, please reach out to your Client Services representative.

### [New message for TrustedForm certificates that can not be found](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/new-message-for-trustedform-certificates-that-can-not-be-found)

TrustedForm certificates must be claimed in order to persist past the duration of the period it is eligible to be claimed. If it hasn't been claimed and an API request is made for a valid certificate URL we have historically returned the message ""certificate not found"". This message is often sent as the rejection reason for the lead and has caused some confusion. Some lead vendors would assume this meant the certificate never existed and that something was wrong with their implementation of the TrustedForm Script. In order to clarify what has occurred in these scenario we are changing the message to ""TrustedForm certificate has expired or could not be found"".The message found in a TrustedForm API response should only be used for informational purposes as it is subject to change to improve our overall user experience. Please ensure that any business decisions that need to be triggered when a certificate can not be accessed use the HTTP response status codes or outcome property.

### [Publisher Provided Data: Unique Identifier](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/publisher-provided-data-unique-identifier)

TrustedForm captures data and events revolving around about how a consumer interacts with the web page the TrustedForm Script is installed on. This begs the question... What happens when the consumer interacts with multiple web pages or screens that each generate their own TrustedForm certificate? This is a common occurrence in co-registration lead generation and requires website publishers to maintain data around which TrustedForm certificates belong together. Now that data can be passed onto the TrustedForm certificate itself!

### [Save Time by Copying a Recipient Flow Step](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/save-time-by-copying-a-recipient-flow-step)

If you have a complicated Recipient step to use in several flows, you can copy that step from one flow to another. Copying a step carries over mappings and rules saving you time and preventing inconsistencies.

**Example of copying a Recipient Step**

1\. Locate the Flow containing the Step to be copied and click Edit Flow.

2\. Locate the Recipient Step to be copied and click the Gear icon on the right side a drop down menu will open and click Copy Step.

![Image #1](https://app.getbeamer.com/pictures?id=155074-Pe-_ve-_ve-_vSd177-977-977-9Ju-_ve-_ve-_vRMX77-9Nmbvv71aHDvvv71FUe-_ve-_vWAp77-9fe-_vQ..&v=4)

3\. In the dialog that appears, select the target destination Flow and click Finish. Note: You can even copy the recipient to the current flow. For example if your flow to send leads to the same CRM with slightly different mappings based on rules.

4\. The target destination flow opens and the copied step appears as the last step. All field mappings, Step Criteria, and other settings will be carried over from the original step.

5\. Be sure to review this step for any fields and rules that may not apply or are different for this flow.

6\. And of course remember to Save your target destination flow to keep this copied step.

- Lead age
- Geolocation
- Browser
- Device type
- Typing speed & keystroke behavior
- Time spent on form
- Originating source

### [Introducing the all-new ActiveProspect look and feel!](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/introducing-the-all_new-activeprospect-look-and-feel-2)

It’s an exciting day for ActiveProspect as we announce the launch of our new website, logo, and redesign of the brand’s entire look and feel! While we loved our previous branding, we wanted the new design and website messaging to properly reflect who we are, what we do, and how we do it.

The timing for our rebranding is ideal as a fresh new look, strong value proposition, and new tagline all combine to clearly articulate our mission of making consent-based marketing the best platform for customer acquisition. We hope you enjoy the new look and feel free to let us know if you have any questions.

### [We've introduced new action icons on our data tables.](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/weve-introduced-new-action-icons-on-our-data-tables)

Introducing data table action icons and improved consistency!

One of our goals is to communicate effectively with our users. This improvement aims to improve clarity and consistency throughout our data tables.

We've added new icons, improved column names, consistent column order, and added color and tooltips to icons.

You might notice a few views without these improvements. We're working on it!

### [Disable a Source](https://whatsnew.activeprospect.com/en/disable-a-source)

Now you can temporarily prevent a source from submitting leads into your flow by disabling that source within LeadConduit.

Leads sent from a disabled source never enter your flow and don’t incur a transaction cost, so it’s a helpful way to manage unexpected situations with your lead sellers or web forms.

![Image #1](https://app.getbeamer.com/pictures?id=109216-SSHvv73vv73vv713dyNFbe-_vWzvv71RdO-_vVBZ77-9aO-_ve-_vQfvv71q77-977-9Q3hP77-9Xw..&v=4)

To get started, navigate to the source tab within your flow editor and disable the source by clicking the ellipsis on the right and selecting the **disable source** option. Follow the same steps to enable your source.

We’re excited to announce a new integration that enhances the transparency and validation of your inbound calls. TrustedForm now supports the inclusion of **TrueCall IDs** in TrustedForm certificates, helping you easily verify the legitimacy of the calls you're receiving.

When a **TrueCall ID** is available, it will appear in the **Publisher Provided Data** section of the TrustedForm certificate. By clicking on the TrueCall ID, you’ll be redirected to the TrueCall platform where you can view detailed information about the call and confirm whether it was genuinely initiated by a potential customer.

TrueCall helps eliminate the risk of unauthorized outbound calls infiltrating inbound marketing campaigns, giving you more confidence in the quality of your leads.

Learn more about how to take advantage of the TrueCall integration in our **[TrueCall Integration on TrustedForm Certificates](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5571263-truecall-integration-on-trustedform-certificates)** community post!

### New Add-On! Trestle: Right Party Contact

From just a phone number and name input, this Add-On verifies whether the information provided by the lead matches Trestle’s authoritative database, determining whether the phone number is valid and whether the lead’s name matches the phone owner.

### Improved Management of Unreviewed Consent Languages

The [Consent Language Manager](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474006-trustedform-consent-language-manager) under TrustedForm Verify helps you track and manage variations of consent language shown to your leads. New variations appear in the Unreviewed tab, where you can approve or reject them for future use.

To help you better manage consent language variations, we’re updating how newly autogenerated unreviewed templates are created. Going forward, phone numbers and email addresses will be replaced with placeholders instead of actual values, with **{{phone}}** for phone numbers and **{{email}}** for email addresses.

This change prevents unnecessary template duplication due to minor variations, making it easier to review and manage consent languages efficiently.

You can use these placeholders along with wildcards when creating approved consent language templates to group similar variations together and reduce clutter. For more details on how to use placeholders and wildcards effectively, check out our updated [community post](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5448162-manually-add-approved-language-to-trustedform-verify-consent-language-manager).

As a reminder, there is a limit of 1,000 unreviewed consent language templates. Be sure to review and approve or reject them regularly to keep your list manageable.

### New Pending Users Feature

In the User Management section of your account you'll see a new tab for ""Pending Users"".

We have added extra validation to prevent your coworkers from creating duplicate ActiveProspect accounts. If someone from your company tries to create a new account, they'll now be prompted to request access to join your already existing account. When they do that, you'll receive an email and be able to see the requestor in the Pending Users section. From there you'll be able to accept or reject the request.

- Settings (formerly the Settings tab)

The new TrustedForm Validity Check feature was just released and gives you the ability to check if certificate URLs you receive are valid or not. This is extremely valuable to lead resellers so they can ensure all their leads have valid TrustedForm certificates and can put an end to guessing whether invalid certificates you were sent are completely fake or simply expired.

Read more about how it works in the [TrustedForm Validity Check community post](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5412855-trustedform-validity-check) and check out the [Validate API documentation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/validating-certificates/) for technical details.

### TrustedForm's Enhanced PII Protection

TrustedForm was created to build trust and transparency between buyers and sellers of internet leads. As we maintain that transparency we also remain committed to protecting the sensitive data that is handled in the process. In order to further support that, TrustedForm certificates now hide all form input data by default until [the certificate has been matched with lead data](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4766190-trustedform-lead-matching) to ensure that PII and other sensitive information is only made available to parties that already have access to it.

This change highlights the importance and encourages the best practice of lead matching to protect everyone involved in the lead generation process against mistake or bad actors. It also makes TrustedForm certificates suitable for ping/post lead distribution so that they can be passed to potential buyers to gain more information about the lead event without exposing information that can be used to contact or identify the lead. For lead publishers/vendors this means your process just became easier as you don't have to pass a different URL on the ping anymore!

If you view a TrustedForm certificate and are prompted to [perform lead matching](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5021187-lead-matching-when-viewing-a-trustedform-certificate), simply enter the email or phone number input during the lead event and the form input values will be revealed to you the same as they have always been. Make sure to automate this process in the your flows by perform lead matching in your API requests when you store certificates. If you run into any issues contact our support team and they will be happy to help.

Don't know if you're already performing lead matching? Check the [Stored Certificate by Match Status card on the TrustedForm Dashboard](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4932869-stored-certificates-by-match-status-on-the-trustedform-dashboard). This will show you how many of your recent certificate were matched with leads or not.

### New Consent Language Detection!

If you are using the TrustedForm Consent product and the TrustedForm Web Script finds consent language on a web page, the certificate that is created will have a section titled ""Consent Language Detected"". This section contains text that was identified as consent language by our proprietary machine learning model. Use this to become more aware of what your leads are consenting to and get new variations approved by your legal team to remain compliant with regulations like the TCPA.

### New Date Format Option in Event Exports

Based on a bunch of feedback from our clients, we've introduced a new option for how dates are formatted during event exports. This new ""yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss"" format is recognized as a ""date/time"" object by spreadsheet applications, allowing you to easily reformat the date into whatever format you need - whether you need just the year for someone's age, just need the date and not the time, etc.

This new format is now the default, but you can deselect the toggle to use the older format.

### Introducing TrustedForm Certificate API v4.0

TrustedForm Certificate API v4.0 is the latest and recommended version when using the TrustedForm product offering. It offers a more organized request & response structure that is extensible to accommodate new products in the future. It also offers discounted pricing for storing certificates you generated and protection against making duplicate requests. [Learn more](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5066720-introducing-trustedform-certificate-api-v4-0)

As part of this version upgrade, TrustedForm Consent has been replaced with TrustedForm Retain. Retain is our newest product that is streamlined for retaining certificates and has a name to match. It is important to remember that having a TrustedForm certificate is not the same as having prior express written consent. You must examine how your leads are being generated to ensure that consent is properly obtained during the process. For this reason, Retain is more appropriate product name.

Self-service customers should read [TrustedForm Self Service: How to use API version 4.0](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5098113-trustedform-self-service-how-to-use-api-version-4-0) for instructions to use the new version.

Managed customers should wait for your customer success manager to reach out to you about upgrading.

### New LeadConduit Feature Released: Buyer Step & Free Buyer Accounts

The Buyer Step allows a paid LeadConduit user to deliver leads to their buyer without having to configure a delivery to the buyers CRM. They simply add a Buyer Step in their flow and can either have it deliver to a partner they have already connected with or invite a new Buyer.

- If the Buyer does not have an account with ActiveProspect or has an account but does not have a subscription to LeadConduit, they will be prompted to create one and configure a delivery to their own CRM. This account is free but does not allow them to filter and reject leads.
- If the Buyer has a paid subscription to LeadConduit, they will be asked which flow they want to add this new source to so they can receive leads from their seller.

[Check it out in our community series for more details!](https://community.activeprospect.com/series/5621463)

### New Accounts Look and Feel!

You may notice a bit of a change around here...we have updated the look and feel of your account to match the other ActiveProspect products. You will now see main account features nested in the left side panel. All the same functionality exists, we just reorganized it to make it clearer to find what you need.

![Image #1](https://app.getbeamer.com/pictures?id=329795-77-977-977-977-9YO-_ve-_ve-_vRTvv73vv73vv71l77-9GO-_ve-_vTvvv73vv70eNe-_vRDvv70yahsv77-9XSI.&v=4)

**Are you an enterprise customer looking for** [Volume Tracking](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4870822-volume-tracking) **?**Don't worry, simply select Billing on the left side panel to check the status of your current volume.

**Looking to invite a colleague to your account?**
Select User Management, then Invite New Member.

**Need your API Key?**
Select Settings, then Technical to copy your API key

With this update, there is a new url to access your account (https://account.activeprospect.com). This means that all traffic to any sso.activeprospect.com url will automatically redirect to the new account.activeprospect.com experience.
Feel free to bookmark for easy access!

We know change can be hard, but thanks for adapting to the new experience.

### New in TrustedForm Verify: Enhanced Compliance Checks

Programmatically validate font size, contrast ratio, and opt-in method, before contacting a lead.

We’ve added three new automated checks to TrustedForm Verify, to help lead buyers enforce consent standards with confidence.

These checks support compliance with the 'clear and conspicuous' consent requirements under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and related standards.

Here’s what each check does:

- **Font Size Check** – Verifies that the consent language shown to each lead meets a minimum font size, ensuring it’s easy to read. [Learn more](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5561944-coming-soon-trustedform-verify-font-size-check)

- **Contrast Ratio Check** – Confirms that consent text stands out clearly against its background for better visibility. [Learn more](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5561943-coming-soon-trustedform-verify-contrast-ratio-check)

- **Opt-in Type Check** – Verifies that each lead opted in using an allowed method, helping you enforce your consent standards. [Learn more](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5619028-coming-soon-trustedform-verify-opt-in-type-check)


These safeguards help protect your brand, reduce regulatory exposure, and improve lead quality. TrustedForm Verify now lets you apply these standards automatically, helping reduce legal risk and ensure every lead meets your compliance criteria before contact.

**Add Enhanced Compliance Checks to your [TrustedForm Verify](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/verify/) process today.**

### SuppressionList in Real-time Bidding

## We have introduced a new capability: using SuppressionList queries in acceptance criteria and pricing to give greater control over your Real-time Bidding!    This addition to Real-time Bidding allows you to leverage SuppressionList to make decisions about whether you want to accept a lead, or change your bid on a lead.     Adding SuppressionList to be used within Acceptance Criteria, Volume Caps and Pricing will allow you to…    \- Reject leads earlier in the process, providing better, more instantaneous feedback to Sellers while minimizing spend on processing leads you don’t want     \- Protect yourself from litigation by not bidding on leads that have already asked to not be contacted    \- Bid more aggressively on leads you perceive to be of higher value    \- Bid less aggressively on leads you perceive to be of lower value    Your account must be enabled for Real-time Bidding and using SuppressionList to use this feature on the Ping.

### Validate TrustedForm Cert URL in LeadConduit Rulesets!

Our customers frequently ask for a way to quickly and easily validate that a TrustedForm certificate URL is real and not expired. And we’ve listened. LeadConduit can now inspect and validate all TrustedForm certificates instantaneously in any ruleset in LeadConduit. That means that a lead submitted with a TrustedForm certificate URL that is fabricated or points to an expired certificate can now be rejected immediately before the lead is processed.

Simply add a rule to your acceptance criteria to check that the format is valid, and LeadConduit will perform an instant deep analysis on the certificate URL, without any cost to you.

Find out what else you can do with this new field type in the community article linked below!

### External Pricing Service

External Pricing Service is an option within Enhanced Real-time Bidding’s Pricing module to enable a flow to use the price returned by a call to an external API. This functionality enables you to use 3rd party or in-house functionality via our “Custom Integration” enhancement instead of relying on LeadConduit’s rules-based pricing module. Thank you to all the @lc-team for all your hard work!!

Read more info in the [External Pricing Service Post!](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4802024-external-pricing-service)

### New limits on the number of unreviewed consent languages

The [Consent Language Manager](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474006-trustedform-consent-language-manager) in the Verify section of TrustedForm helps you organize and track variations of consent language shown to your leads. New variations appear in the _Unreviewed_ tab, where you can decide to approve or reject them for future use.

We’ve noticed that for some customers, this section can grow too large, which may affect the performance of certain features. To address this, we’re introducing a limit of 1,000 consent languages in the _Unreviewed_ tab. Once this limit is reached, new variations will stop populating until the existing ones are reviewed.

If you hit this limit, be sure to review your consent languages to make room. You can also use wildcards to group similar languages together and reduce clutter. We're working on additional updates to make the review process even smoother—stay tuned!

### ""Lookback Period"" added to SuppressionList in Enhanced Real-time Bidding

**Our SuppressionList in Enhanced Real-time Bidding capability has been updated to provide you more control over how you check your lists!**

Now, if you want to disregard more recent matches, you can optionally set a ""lookback period"". For example, if you'd like to only consider a record a ""duplicate"" if they were added within the last 30 days, you'd select ""30"", and ""Days"" as shown in the documentation linked below.

Note that this works _independently_ of SuppressionList's ""auto pruning"" functionality, allowing you to fine-tune your checks without compromising the integrity of your lists.

Coming Soon




April 05, 2023

### New data security enhancement limiting access to TrustedForm Certificate session replays

Beginning July 5, 2023, new TrustedForm certificates will, by default, hide all form input data in session replays to protect against any possible unauthorized access of the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of consumers. Note: All TrustedForm Certificates created prior to this update will have no change.

With this change, the full session replays (with form inputs) will only be viewable by users who have demonstrated that they already have access to the PII in the session replay. This enhancement ensures that consumer data cannot be accessed through the TrustedForm Certificate by any party who doesn’t already have access to the consumer data. This new data protection is achieved without compromising the current session replay functionality of TrustedForm.

### Share URLs: Now Easier to Access!

We’ve made it easier to access Share URLs. Previously, Share URLs were hidden in the Certificate History tab, making them hard to find. To improve accessibility, the Share button has now been moved to the certificate header, making it quicker and simpler to share your certificates. This change will only apply to **new certificates** moving forward and will not be retroactively applied to existing ones.

**Share URLs** allow customers to share certificates with other parties without requiring authentication. This feature is often used when sharing certificates in the event of a complaint or litigation, allowing legal teams, judges, or other parties who may not be members of the customer’s account to view the certificate.

Please note that Share URLs are openly viewable by any party that receives them. As such, they should be used cautiously and in accordance with best practices for sharing.

Learn more about [How to share TrustedForm certificates](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5139455-how-do-you-share-a-trustedform-certificate) in our updated community post.

- Improved the accuracy of clicks shown in session replays. Different browsers render web pages differently which made it possible for the location of clicks to be slightly off in session replays.

### Certificate Claims chart correction

The Certificate Claims chart was previously using the incorrect date on the x-axis. This has been corrected to reflect the date on which the certificate was claimed rather than when it was created.

### TrustedForm Verify: New form\_submitted Field Now Available

We're excited to introduce the new **`form_submitted`** field in the TrustedForm Verify API response! This boolean field indicates whether a form was successfully submitted ( `true`) or abandoned before submission ( `false`).

Included in every Verify request, the `form_submitted` field provides a programmatic way to detect and verify form submissions, offering clear insights into form activity and giving lead buyers greater confidence in their data. This update also supports features like extended retention windows for submitted leads.

We’ve updated our [community post](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5549726-trustedform-verify-introducing-form-submit) and [TrustedForm API documentation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Verify/) with more details about this feature—be sure to check it out!

### New Tools to Identify Risky Lead Sources in TrustedForm

We’ve launched new updates in our TrustedForm app to help you identify leads from unverified domains, a key risk for compliance and lead quality. In the Home tab, you’ll now see three new charts showing the breakdown of retained certificates across confirmed vs. unconfirmed domains, the percentage of unverified sources, and a vendor list.

In the Retain tab, any new certificates from unverified domains will now include a clear warning icon. These updates apply only to new certificates moving forward.

**Why This Matters**
Buying leads from anonymous sources puts your business at serious risk. If a lead generator hasn’t confirmed domain ownership, they can’t be held accountable, and that opens the door to regulatory violations, fraud, and low-quality leads.

![✅](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/2705.png)**Compliance:** When domain ownership is confirmed, we can alert sources about potential TCPA issues and help all parties stay compliant.
![🛡](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/1f6e1.png)️ **Fraud prevention:** Bad actors hide behind anonymity. If a domain isn’t verified, you have no way of knowing who’s behind the lead.
![🔎](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/1f50e.png)**Trust:** Your legal and compliance teams need transparency. If a vendor can’t (or won’t) confirm their domains, it raises serious concerns about credibility.

**What You Should Do Now** If you're buying leads from unconfirmed domains, it’s time to act. Ask your vendors to confirm all domains used to generate your leads in ActiveProspect. This process gives you the transparency needed to protect your business.

We’ve created a vendor outreach email template to make it easy to get started.

### One-Click Subdomain Registration is Here!

Managing domains in TrustedForm just got faster and more intuitive.

### ![✅](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/2705.png)**Register All Subdomains Automatically**

You can now register **all subdomains** with a single checkbox when adding a new domain. No more repetitive manual entries—just check “Register all subdomains” and you’re done.

> ![⚠️](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/26a0.png) Heads-up: If there are subdomains you **don’t** want to register, you’ll need to add each one manually instead.

### ![💡](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/1f4a1.png) Get Started in Seconds:

- Go to **Domain Settings**

- Add a domain

- Check **“Register all subdomains”**


Want more details? Read our [Verify Domain Ownership Help Article](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4649879-verify-domain-ownership)

### ![👀](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/1f440.png) ICYMI: **Unowned Certificates Now Highlighted**

To help you maintain better visibility and control, **certificates from domains without a registered owner** are now **highlighted in your dashboard**. Quickly see what’s missing and take action.

### TrustedForm Facebook Certificate Claims Impacted

Claims made for TrustedForm certificates that originated from Facebook Lead Ads between 11:15am CST and 12:53pm CST saw an abnormally high error rate that caused some requests to receive an unexpected error. If you experienced any errors while trying to claim certificates during this time we recommend that you retry your requests now. Any failed attempts to claim using LeadConduit(powered by ActiveProspect) during this period will be automatically resubmitted.

We apologize for any inconvenience this caused and thank you for your patience.

Introducing data table action icons and improved consistency!

One of our goals is to communicate effectively with our users. This improvement aims to improve clarity and consistency throughout our data tables.

We've added new icons, improved column names, consistent column order, and added color and tooltips to icons.

You might notice a few views without these improvements. We're working on it!

### New message for TrustedForm certificates that can not be found

TrustedForm certificates must be claimed in order to persist past the duration of the period it is eligible to be claimed. If it hasn't been claimed and an API request is made for a valid certificate URL we have historically returned the message ""certificate not found"". This message is often sent as the rejection reason for the lead and has caused some confusion. Some lead vendors would assume this meant the certificate never existed and that something was wrong with their implementation of the TrustedForm Script. In order to clarify what has occurred in these scenario we are changing the message to ""TrustedForm certificate has expired or could not be found"".The message found in a TrustedForm API response should only be used for informational purposes as it is subject to change to improve our overall user experience. Please ensure that any business decisions that need to be triggered when a certificate can not be accessed use the HTTP response status codes or outcome property.

### Disable a Source

Now you can temporarily prevent a source from submitting leads into your flow by disabling that source within LeadConduit.

Leads sent from a disabled source never enter your flow and don’t incur a transaction cost, so it’s a helpful way to manage unexpected situations with your lead sellers or web forms.

![Image #1](https://app.getbeamer.com/pictures?id=109216-SSHvv73vv73vv713dyNFbe-_vWzvv71RdO-_vVBZ77-9aO-_ve-_vQfvv71q77-977-9Q3hP77-9Xw..&v=4)

To get started, navigate to the source tab within your flow editor and disable the source by clicking the ellipsis on the right and selecting the **disable source** option. Follow the same steps to enable your source.

### Two Factor Authentication Now Available

Step-up your ActiveProspect account security with Two Factor Authentication (2FA).

You are probably familiar with 2FA. 2FA is an extra layer of security used to ensure when you are logging into your ActiveProspect account, you are who you say you are. Serving as a validation tool, 2FA works to provide your ActiveProspect account the security you need. First, a user will enter their username and a password. Then, instead of immediately gaining account access, they will be required to provide a custom code received in a text message.

Go to your user account settings to enable for yourself or make a request to Support@ActiveProspect.com to enable for all users on your Account.

[How to Enable 2FA](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4579643-two-factor-authentication)

### Drill down on stats in any report

LeadConduit's new reporting drill-down feature brings the numbers in your reporting table to life by providing clickable stats within the rows of your report.

![Image #1](https://app.getbeamer.com/pictures?id=91484-BO-_ve-_vTFEQxrvv70D77-977-977-977-977-977-977-9xK85Qwbvv70le9WVdu-_ve-_vQVw77-9&v=4)

Drilling down into the individual lead details makes it easy to investigate leads submitted without TrustedForm certificates or scan a list of leads from Texas that were rejected as duplicates last week.

Whether you’re troubleshooting or optimizing, reporting drill-down gives you the granularity you need when you need it.

Visit your [reporting page](https://next.leadconduit.com/reports) and start drilling down today!

### New Integration! Lead Scoring by Faraday

Create outstanding customer experiences with the power of AI. Faraday includes everything you need to transform your customer data into actionable predictive insights, all in 6-8 weeks.

Using Faraday's API, you can score and enhance leads as they flow through LeadConduit, empowering you to make decisions in real time.

Our integration with Faraday.io is Bring Your Own Credentials (BYOC), meaning you'll need to sign up independently with Faraday. The patterns uncovered via the machine learning algorithms will be custom to your lead data and require your own account.

[Check out the Faraday integration page in our catalog for more details.](https://activeprospect.com/integrations/faraday/score/)

### Forensiq by Impact

LeadConduit now offers an integration with Forensiq by Impact.

Forensiq uses machine-learning and advanced bot fingerprinting to identify and block ad fraud so you can eliminate costly, ineffectual marketing spend and keep your data clean.

Combined with TrustedForm, which independently verifies the origin and authenticity of internet leads, Forensiq receives the most reliable data possible to make informed determinations about fraud.

**BYOC:** To provide the best of both worlds, LeadConduit's Forensiq integration allows clients to Bring Your Own Credentials so you're able to access dashboards and reports based only on your lead flows.

[Check out the Forensiq by Impact integration page!](https://activeprospect.com/integrations/forensiq/check/)

### TrustedForm: Extended Claims

Now the full power of TrustedForm is available to anyone buying leads up to 3 months old! When you buy leads from another TrustedForm client, ActiveProspect can enable the vendor's TrustedForm account to extend the claim period for any certificate claimed by the vendor account.

There are no changes required to the TrustedForm script and since the vendor is already claiming certificates for the leads they sell within the standard claim period, there are zero changes to the lead selling process to extend the claim period for these certificates.

### Introducing sticky headers and improved button placement!

With sticky headers, tasks like saving a flow or adding a new step are available no matter how far down the screen you've scrolled. This makes key actions easier to find - and you more productive.

![Image #1](https://app.getbeamer.com/pictures?id=54272-77-9MFrvv73vv70_77-977-977-9G1_vv70177-977-9RlTvv71bOGd377-9Yu-_vdWy77-977-9YO-_vV4.&v=4)

Wondering where a button went? Chances are we’ve moved it to the header in the top right of your screen. This way, there’s greater consistency (and less to think about) when you need to take an action within LeadConduit.

Have an idea for improving usability? Let us know in the feedback section below!

For anyone collecting web leads from within a [Single Page Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPA) this means you're now able to control precisely when the TrustedForm script stops recording end-user events without waiting for the page to unload.

### TrustedForm API Consent Failure Outcome

TrustedForm API users with a subscription that includes Consent features are now able to take advantage of the outcome field to do more than tell whether or not a claim was successful. The API also considers factors that affect your ability to verify that consumer has given expressed written consent to be contacted. Currently this will cause the outcome field to respond as ""failure"" if none of the provided fingerprints match, forbidden scan terms ware found or required scan terms were missing. In the future we plan to consider additional factors to increase your confidence that consent was provided. If you want to ensure that your lead has consent be sure to review or filter out leads when the outcome is failure.

\-\-\-

As such the description of the outcome field has been updated to the following:
""The result of the attempt to verify consent. Success indicates that the certificate was claimed and did not generate any warnings related to consent verification. Failure indicates that the certificate was claimed but generated warnings because no fingerprints matched, forbidden scan terms ware found or required scan terms were missing. Error indicates that the certificate was not claimed and the request should be reviewed and potentially retried.""

### Introducing the all-new ActiveProspect look and feel!

It’s an exciting day for ActiveProspect as we announce the launch of our new website, logo, and redesign of the brand’s entire look and feel! While we loved our previous branding, we wanted the new design and website messaging to properly reflect who we are, what we do, and how we do it.

The timing for our rebranding is ideal as a fresh new look, strong value proposition, and new tagline all combine to clearly articulate our mission of making consent-based marketing the best platform for customer acquisition. We hope you enjoy the new look and feel free to let us know if you have any questions.

### Save Time by Copying a Recipient Flow Step

If you have a complicated Recipient step to use in several flows, you can copy that step from one flow to another. Copying a step carries over mappings and rules saving you time and preventing inconsistencies.

**Example of copying a Recipient Step**

1\. Locate the Flow containing the Step to be copied and click Edit Flow.

2\. Locate the Recipient Step to be copied and click the Gear icon on the right side a drop down menu will open and click Copy Step.

![Image #1](https://app.getbeamer.com/pictures?id=155074-Pe-_ve-_ve-_vSd177-977-977-9Ju-_ve-_ve-_vRMX77-9Nmbvv71aHDvvv71FUe-_ve-_vWAp77-9fe-_vQ..&v=4)

3\. In the dialog that appears, select the target destination Flow and click Finish. Note: You can even copy the recipient to the current flow. For example if your flow to send leads to the same CRM with slightly different mappings based on rules.

4\. The target destination flow opens and the copied step appears as the last step. All field mappings, Step Criteria, and other settings will be carried over from the original step.

5\. Be sure to review this step for any fields and rules that may not apply or are different for this flow.

6\. And of course remember to Save your target destination flow to keep this copied step.

### New Integration! HubSpot Create or Update Contact

LeadConduit now offers a **Hubspot Create or Update Contact** integration.

**Create or Update** creates a contact if it doesn't exist in an account already, or updates a contact with the latest property values if it already exists in an account.

This action is useful for collecting both updated and additional information versus Create Contact, which rejects duplicates.

**Just in case you didn't know:** HubSpot CRM is a flexible, intuitive solution for managing your prospects and sales pipeline. It is also 100% free for unlimited users and contacts.

### New Integration! IPQualityScore: Phone Validation

The IPQualityScore: Phone Validation integration verifies phone numbers and identifies suspicious numbers in real-time with phone number reputation scores.

IPQualityScore's Phone Validation service performs carrier lookups by API in any region to detect disconnected phone numbers and retrieve important carrier info including line types to determine if a number is a VOIP, landline, mobile/wireless, or prepaid line.

Check out IPQualityScore: Phone Validation in our [community post](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4540140-ipqualityscore-phone-validation) and [integration catalog](https://activeprospect.com/integrations/ipqualityscore/phone_validation/) for more details!

### Share Reports with the Click of a Button!

Ever wish you could share your reports with a lead partner or colleague? With LeadConduit’s new shared reporting feature - you can!

![Image #1](https://app.getbeamer.com/pictures?id=46088-77-977-9RTPvv71A77-9Su-_vQYQ3rfvv73vv70M77-9dmc577-9JO-_ve-_ve-_vdyJ77-977-9QRw.&v=4)

Shared reporting lets you generate a unique URL for any report in your account. Just copy, paste, and share that URL with anyone you’d like to give access. There's no need to log in to see the report, so you can confidently curate insights for non-account holders and start sharing with the click of a button.

Need to revoke access to a report? You can do that too! Visit the **[reports page](https://next.leadconduit.com/reports)** and give it a try.

Announcement




January 24, 2022

### Data Capture for Android Users of TrustedForm

This morning we detected a sudden issue preventing TrustedForm certificates from being generated for consumers using an Android operating system. Since then the issue has been resolved and have found the root cause to be a change made by Amazon Web Services (AWS), our cloud services provider, to a security feature meant to block malicious database attacks. The impact of this change prevented the creation of TrustedForm Certificates by Android users from approximately 08:00 - 15:55 UTC.

To mitigate incidents like this from happening in the future we are adding monitors to alert us of anomalous changes in our firewall traffic. If you have any questions regarding yesterday’s outage, please reach out to your Client Services representative.

### Introducing an Easier Way to Test Your Lead Flows

LeadConduit now gives you the power to test your lead flows without having to leave the app!

![Image #1](https://app.getbeamer.com/pictures?id=49797-c0Pvv73vv713Ku-_vWQ677-9HF0i77-9SmUkeX0gVO-_vVLvv71lNmTDou-_ve-_ve-_vQ..&v=4)

Whether you’re a first-time flow creator or a seasoned vet, testing your flow is a critical part of the “go-live” process. LeadConduit's new testing tool makes this process easier by providing a pre-populated test form accessible from anywhere within the flow editor.

If you’re confident in your flow’s configuration but need an easy way to submit leads manually, you can use the tool for that too!

Click the **Test Your Flow** button within the sources, fields, or step editor to get started.

### Real-Time Bidding now enhanced with TrustedForm data

## Combine the insights of TrustedForm with the power of LeadConduit:

![✔](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/2714.png) Stop leads you don’t want to buy from ever entering your system, before you pay for them.

![✔](https://static.getbeamer.com/emoji/2714.png) Leverage TrustedForm event data to gain a competitive advantage by paying the right price for the right leads.

TrustedForm data is now available to use in your real-time pricing, acceptance criteria, and volume cap rules. The ability to enhance your purchasing rulesets on the ping and post just got much more robust! TrustedForm insights make better bids and improve outcomes, while LeadConduit’s real-time ping/post bidding solution gives you the information you need to make the right decisions before you purchase a lead.

Learn how to start optimizing your rulesets with TrustedForm from our [community article](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4316883-enhanced-real-time-bidding-with-trustedform-data-services)

## New to TrustedForm?

ActiveProspect’s TrustedForm is the industry standard for documenting consent and certifying the authenticity of internet leads. TrustedForm captures critical data about the lead generation event so you can use that data to inform your bidding process and make the right decision about every lead you buy.

When TrustedForm generates a certificate, it also captures a wide range of information about every lead - information you can leverage as part of your LeadConduit real-time bidding workflow, such as:

- Lead age
- Geolocation
- Browser
- Device type
- Typing speed & keystroke behavior
- Time spent on form
- Originating source

### Publisher Provided Data: Unique Identifier

TrustedForm captures data and events revolving around about how a consumer interacts with the web page the TrustedForm Script is installed on. This begs the question... What happens when the consumer interacts with multiple web pages or screens that each generate their own TrustedForm certificate? This is a common occurrence in co-registration lead generation and requires website publishers to maintain data around which TrustedForm certificates belong together. Now that data can be passed onto the TrustedForm certificate itself!

### TrustedForm Verify

Today we introduce the newest product offering in the TrustedForm family!

Verify gives you the tools you need to assure yourself that leads you have purchased have given meaningful consent to be contacted. Purchased leads often originate from hundreds or even thousands of different sources. As a marketer it is your job to make sure you only reach out to leads that were generated in a compliant manner to protect your business from unnecessary violations, litigation and poor consumer experiences that hurt your reputation.

![Image #1](https://app.getbeamer.com/pictures?id=361614-Y--_vVQl77-9bAZB77-977-977-977-977-9RHvvv70scDLvv73vv70yAA8Y77-977-9J23vv73vv73vv70.&v=4)

When you view the Verify section of the TrustedForm application you will be taken to your Consent Language Manager. Here you will see all the different variations of consent languages used to generate the leads you purchased. Have your compliance team review them and approve all the ones that meet their requirements while rejecting the ones that don’t. Then simply use the verify operation within the TrustedForm Certificate API for all the new leads you plan to purchase and the result will tell you whether you should accept it or not.

Expand your compliance assessment and make sure you only purchase leads with meaningful consent using TrustedForm Verify!

### TrustedForm Verify: New column additions!

We are excited to announce the latest updates to TrustedForm Verify, which now includes two new columns: the Count column and the Sample Certificates column!

- **Count:** the counter shows the number of times a particular consent language was detected in certificates that were Retained or Verified.
- **Sample Certificates:** this allows you to view the most recently retained or verified certificate associated with the detected consent language.

With the following additions, you can easily track how often a particular consent language is detected and keep note of where the detected consent languages are coming from.
