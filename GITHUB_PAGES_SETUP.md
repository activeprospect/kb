# GitHub Pages Setup Complete

## What Was Done

1. **Moved all documentation to `/docs` folder**
   - All content from root moved to `/docs/`
   - Repository root is now clean
   - Standard GitHub Pages structure

2. **Updated Jekyll configuration**
   - `_config.yml` now in `/docs/` where Jekyll expects it
   - Simplified configuration
   - Removed complex permalink rules

3. **Updated GitHub Actions workflow**
   - Builds Jekyll from `/docs/` directory
   - Uploads the correct `_site` directory
   - No baseurl overrides

4. **Created redirect from root**
   - `index.html` in root redirects to `/docs/`

## What You Need to Do

### IMPORTANT: Configure GitHub Pages Settings

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: https://github.com/activeprospect/kb
2. Click on **Settings**
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select:
   - **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main**
   - Folder: **/ (root)** (NOT /docs - we're using GitHub Actions)
5. Click **Save**

### Wait for Deployment

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Watch for the deployment to complete (should take 2-5 minutes)
3. Once complete, your site should be available at:
   - https://reimagined-potato-jngm138.pages.github.io/

## Clean URLs

Your documentation will now be available at clean URLs like:
- `/Introduction/welcome`
- `/GettingStarted/first-flow-creation`
- `/LeadsAndEvents/Ping/pricing-rules`

No more `/build/UserGuide/` in the URLs!

## If It Still Doesn't Work

1. Check the Actions tab for build errors
2. Clear your browser cache (GitHub Pages can cache aggressively)
3. Try an incognito/private browser window
4. Wait 10 minutes - GitHub Pages can take time to update

## Structure

Your repository now follows the standard pattern:
```
/kb (repository root)
  ├── index.html (redirects to /docs/)
  ├── .github/workflows/deploy.yml (builds and deploys)
  └── /docs/ (all your documentation)
      ├── _config.yml (Jekyll configuration)
      ├── Gemfile (Ruby dependencies)
      ├── index.md (homepage)
      └── [all documentation folders]
```

This is the standard, recommended way to use GitHub Pages with Jekyll.
