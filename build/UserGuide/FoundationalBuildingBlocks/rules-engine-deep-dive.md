## Advanced Rule Syntax and Operators

### Comparison Operators

**Standard Comparison Operations:**
```javascript
// Equality and inequality
lead.age == 25                    // Exact equality
lead.state != 'CA'                // Not equal
lead.income > 50000               // Greater than
lead.credit_score >= 650          // Greater than or equal
lead.debt_ratio < 0.43            // Less than
lead.employment_months <= 24      // Less than or equal

// String comparisons with case sensitivity
lead.first_name == 'John'         // Case-sensitive equality
lower(lead.first_name) == 'john'  // Case-insensitive comparison
lead.email != null                // Null value checking
trim(lead.company) != ''          // Empty string validation
```

**Advanced String Operations:**
```javascript
// Pattern matching and containment
lead.email contains '@gmail.com'           // Contains substring
lead.phone starts_with '+1'                // Starts with pattern
lead.company ends_with 'Inc'               // Ends with pattern
lead.description matches '^[A-Z].*'        // Regular expression matching

// List and array operations
lead.state in ['CA', 'NY', 'TX', 'FL']     // Value in list
lead.interests contains 'real estate'       // Array contains value
lead.tags not_contains 'exclude'           // Array does not contain
lead.phone_numbers.length > 1              // Array length comparison
```

**Numeric and Mathematical Comparisons:**
```javascript
// Range and boundary checking
lead.age between 18 and 65                 // Range inclusion
lead.income not_between 0 and 25000        // Range exclusion
lead.credit_score in_range [600, 850]      // Inclusive range
abs(lead.debt_ratio - 0.28) < 0.05        // Mathematical tolerance

// Complex mathematical expressions
(lead.loan_amount / lead.income) <= 0.28   // Debt-to-income ratio
round(lead.monthly_payment * 12, 2) == lead.annual_payment // Precision comparison
lead.down_payment >= (lead.home_value * 0.20) // Percentage calculation
```

### Logical Operators and Boolean Logic

**Boolean Combination Patterns:**
```javascript
// AND logic for multiple conditions
lead.age >= 18 && lead.age <= 65 && lead.income >= 40000

// OR logic for alternative conditions
lead.state == 'CA' || lead.state == 'NY' || lead.state == 'TX'

// NOT logic for exclusion conditions
!(lead.credit_score < 600) && !(lead.bankruptcy_history == true)

// Complex nested boolean expressions
(lead.age >= 21 && lead.income >= 50000) && 
(lead.credit_score >= 650 || (lead.employment_length >= 24 && lead.down_payment >= 0.25))

// Conditional grouping with parentheses
(lead.property_type == 'Single Family' || lead.property_type == 'Condo') &&
(lead.occupancy == 'Primary' || lead.occupancy == 'Secondary') &&
lead.loan_purpose in ['Purchase', 'Refinance']
```

**Advanced Boolean Patterns:**
```javascript
// XOR (exclusive or) logic implementation
(lead.has_cosigner == true && lead.joint_application == false) ||
(lead.has_cosigner == false && lead.joint_application == true)

// NAND (not and) logic patterns
!((lead.bankruptcy_history == true) && (lead.foreclosure_history == true))

// Complex conditional chains with short-circuiting
lead.income >= 100000 || 
(lead.income >= 75000 && lead.credit_score >= 700) ||
(lead.income >= 50000 && lead.credit_score >= 750 && lead.down_payment >= 0.20)
```

### Temporal and Date-Based Rules

**Date and Time Comparisons:**
```javascript
// Date range and recency checking
lead.created_at >= '2024-01-01'                    // Date after threshold
days_between(lead.created_at, now()) <= 30        // Recency validation
lead.birth_date between '1960-01-01' and '2005-12-31' // Date range

// Business day and timing logic
is_business_day(now())                             // Business day check
hour_of_day(now()) between 9 and 17               // Business hours
day_of_week(lead.created_at) in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]   // Weekday validation

// Age and duration calculations
age_from_birthdate(lead.birth_date) >= 18         // Age calculation
months_between(lead.employment_start, now()) >= 24 // Employment length
years_at_address(lead.address_date) >= 2          // Residence stability
```

**Temporal Business Logic:**
```javascript
// Seasonal and cyclical rules
month_of_year(now()) in [10, 11, 12, 1]          // Holiday season
quarter_of_year(lead.created_at) == 4             // Q4 processing
is_weekend(lead.created_at)                       // Weekend detection

// Time-sensitive processing
lead.urgency == 'High' && 
hours_between(lead.created_at, now()) <= 2        // Urgent processing

// Expiration and validity checking
add_days(lead.quote_date, 30) >= now()            // Quote validity
lead.certification_expiry > now()                 // Certification status
```

## Complex Rule Sets and Nested Logic

### Multi-Condition Rule Architectures

**Hierarchical Decision Trees:**
```javascript
// Loan approval decision tree
Rule: "Loan Approval Logic"
Conditions:
  IF (lead.credit_score >= 740) THEN
    IF (lead.debt_to_income <= 0.28) THEN
      IF (lead.down_payment >= 0.10) THEN "Prime Approval"
      ELSE "Standard Approval"
    ELSE 
      IF (lead.down_payment >= 0.20) THEN "Standard Approval"
      ELSE "Conditional Approval"
  ELSE IF (lead.credit_score >= 680) THEN
    IF (lead.debt_to_income <= 0.36) THEN
      IF (lead.down_payment >= 0.15) THEN "Standard Approval"
      ELSE "Conditional Approval"
    ELSE "Manual Review"
  ELSE IF (lead.credit_score >= 620) THEN
    IF (lead.debt_to_income <= 0.43 && lead.down_payment >= 0.25) THEN
      "Subprime Approval"
    ELSE "Manual Review"
  ELSE "Decline"
```

**Territory and Routing Logic:**
```javascript
// Geographic territory assignment
Rule: "Territory Assignment"
Conditions:
  IF (lead.state in ['CA', 'NV', 'AZ', 'OR', 'WA']) THEN
    IF (lead.metropolitan_area in ['Los Angeles', 'San Francisco', 'San Diego']) THEN
      "West Coast Premium"
    ELSE IF (lead.population_density >= 1000) THEN
      "West Coast Urban"
    ELSE "West Coast Standard"
  ELSE IF (lead.state in ['NY', 'NJ', 'CT', 'MA', 'PA']) THEN
    IF (lead.postal_code matches '^1[0-2].*') THEN
      "Northeast Metro"
    ELSE "Northeast Standard"
  ELSE IF (lead.state in ['TX', 'OK', 'AR', 'LA']) THEN
    IF (lead.city in ['Dallas', 'Houston', 'Austin', 'San Antonio']) THEN
      "South Central Major Markets"
    ELSE "South Central Standard"
  ELSE "National"
```

### Rule Set Composition and Dependencies

**Dependent Rule Execution:**
```javascript
// Quality scoring with dependent calculations
Rule Set: "Lead Quality Assessment"

Rule 1: "Base Quality Score"
lead.base_quality_score = 
  (lead.credit_score / 850 * 40) +
  (lead.income / 200000 * 30) +
  (lead.employment_stability_score * 20) +
  (lead.address_stability_score * 10)

Rule 2: "Quality Tier Assignment" (depends on Rule 1)
IF (lead.base_quality_score >= 80) THEN lead.quality_tier = "Premium"
ELSE IF (lead.base_quality_score >= 60) THEN lead.quality_tier = "Standard"
ELSE IF (lead.base_quality_score >= 40) THEN lead.quality_tier = "Subprime"
ELSE lead.quality_tier = "Decline"

Rule 3: "Pricing Assignment" (depends on Rule 2)
IF (lead.quality_tier == "Premium") THEN lead.price_tier = "A"
ELSE IF (lead.quality_tier == "Standard") THEN lead.price_tier = "B"
ELSE IF (lead.quality_tier == "Subprime") THEN lead.price_tier = "C"
ELSE lead.price_tier = "N/A"
```

**Rule Orchestration Patterns:**
```javascript
// Multi-stage validation workflow
Rule Sequence: "Lead Validation Pipeline"

Stage 1: "Data Completeness"
required_fields_complete = 
  (lead.first_name != null && lead.first_name != '') &&
  (lead.last_name != null && lead.last_name != '') &&
  (lead.email != null && matches(lead.email, '^[^@]+@[^@]+\\.[^@]+$')) &&
  (lead.phone != null && matches(lead.phone, '^\\+?1?[0-9]{10}$'))

Stage 2: "Data Quality" (only if Stage 1 passes)
data_quality_score = 
  (email_deliverable(lead.email) ? 25 : 0) +
  (phone_valid(lead.phone) ? 25 : 0) +
  (address_valid(lead.address) ? 25 : 0) +
  (name_quality_score(lead.first_name, lead.last_name) * 25)

Stage 3: "Business Qualification" (only if Stage 2 >= 60)
business_qualified = 
  lead.age >= 18 &&
  lead.income >= source.minimum_income &&
  lead.credit_score >= source.minimum_credit &&
  lead.state in source.approved_states
```

### Scalability and Resource Management

**High-Volume Processing Optimization:**
```javascript
// Efficient rule design patterns
// Good: Simple, fast evaluation
Rule: lead.state == 'CA' && lead.income >= 50000

// Better: Short-circuit evaluation with most selective condition first
Rule: lead.income >= 100000 && lead.state in ['CA', 'NY', 'TX'] && complex_calculation(lead)

// Best: Cached expensive operations
Rule: lead.cached_credit_tier == 'Premium' && lead.geographic_tier in ['A', 'B']

// Efficient list operations
Rule: lead.state in precomputed_high_value_states && lead.product_interest in target_products

// Optimized mathematical expressions
Rule: lead.precomputed_debt_ratio <= 0.28 // Better than: (lead.monthly_debt / lead.monthly_income) <= 0.28
```

## Integration with External Systems

### API-Based Rule Enhancement

**External Service Integration:**
```javascript
// Credit bureau integration
Rule: external_credit_score(lead.ssn, lead.address) >= 650

// Address validation service
Rule: address_validation_service(lead.address).deliverable == true

// Income verification service
Rule: income_verification(lead.ssn, lead.employer).verified_income >= lead.stated_income * 0.9

// Fraud detection service
Rule: fraud_detection_api(lead.email, lead.phone, lead.ip_address).risk_score <= 0.3

// Real estate valuation
Rule: property_value_api(lead.property_address).estimated_value >= lead.loan_amount
```

**Dynamic Rule Configuration:**
```javascript
// External pricing service integration
Rule: external_pricing_service(lead.profile, market.conditions).price >= source.minimum_price

// Business intelligence integration
Rule: lead.lifetime_value_prediction >= customer_acquisition_cost * 3.0

// Market data integration
Rule: current_market_conditions().demand_index >= 0.7 && lead.urgency == 'High'
```
