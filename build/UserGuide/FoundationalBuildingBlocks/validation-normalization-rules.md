### Personal Information Normalization

**Name Standardization and Parsing:**
```javascript
// Name component standardization
lead.first_name = proper_case(trim(lead.first_name))
lead.middle_name = proper_case(trim(lead.middle_name))
lead.last_name = proper_case(trim(lead.last_name))
lead.suffix = standardize_suffix(lead.suffix)  // Jr. -> Jr., III -> III

// Business name standardization
lead.company_name = standardize_business_name(lead.company_name)
// "ABC Corp." -> "ABC Corporation"
// "XYZ LLC" -> "XYZ Limited Liability Company"

// Title standardization
lead.title = standardize_title(lead.title)
// "Mr" -> "Mr.", "DR" -> "Dr.", "prof" -> "Prof."

// Full name composition with proper formatting
lead.full_name = compose_full_name(lead.title, lead.first_name, 
                                   lead.middle_name, lead.last_name, lead.suffix)
```

**Contact Information Normalization:**
```javascript
// Email address normalization
lead.email = normalize_email(lead.email)
// "John.DOE@Gmail.COM" -> "john.doe@gmail.com"
// "user+tag@example.com" -> "user@example.com" (configurable)

// Phone number standardization
lead.phone = normalize_phone(lead.phone, 'E164')
// "(555) 123-4567" -> "+15551234567"
// "555.123.4567 ext 123" -> "+15551234567x123"

// "90210-1234" -> "90210", "SW1A 1AA" -> "SW1A 1AA"
```

### Numeric and Date Normalization

**Financial Data Standardization:**
```javascript
// Currency and monetary value normalization
lead.annual_income = normalize_currency(lead.annual_income)
// "$50,000.00" -> 50000.00
// "50K" -> 50000.00

lead.loan_amount = round_to_nearest(normalize_currency(lead.loan_amount), 100)
// "$123,456.78" -> 123500.00 (rounded to nearest $100)

// Percentage value normalization
lead.debt_to_income_ratio = normalize_percentage(lead.debt_to_income_ratio)
// "28%" -> 0.28
// "0.28" -> 0.28

// Credit score normalization
lead.credit_score = clamp(normalize_integer(lead.credit_score), 300, 850)
// "750.5" -> 750, "900" -> 850 (clamped to valid range)
```

**Date and Time Standardization:**
```javascript
// Date format normalization
lead.birth_date = normalize_date(lead.birth_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD')
// "12/25/1990" -> "1990-12-25"
// "Dec 25, 1990" -> "1990-12-25"

// Timestamp normalization with timezone handling
lead.created_at = normalize_timestamp(lead.created_at, 'UTC')
// "2024-01-15 3:30 PM PST" -> "2024-01-15T23:30:00Z"

// Age calculation and validation
lead.calculated_age = age_from_birthdate(lead.birth_date)
lead.age = lead.calculated_age  // Replace stated age with calculated age
```

## Advanced Validation Patterns

### Custom Business Rule Validation

**Industry-Specific Validation Rules:**
```javascript
// Mortgage industry validation
Rule: "Mortgage Application Validation"
Conditions:
  - lead.loan_to_value_ratio <= 0.95
  - lead.debt_to_income_ratio <= 0.43
  - lead.credit_score >= 580
  - lead.employment_length >= 24 || lead.employment_status == 'self_employed'
  - lead.property_type in ['Single Family', 'Condo', 'Townhome']
  - lead.occupancy in ['Primary', 'Secondary', 'Investment']

// Insurance industry validation  
Rule: "Insurance Application Validation"
Conditions:
  - lead.age >= 18 && lead.age <= 80
  - lead.coverage_amount >= 50000 && lead.coverage_amount <= 1000000
  - lead.health_conditions.length <= 3
  - lead.driving_violations.length <= 2
  - lead.claims_history.length <= 1
```

**Regulatory Compliance Validation:**
```javascript
// TCPA compliance validation
Rule: "TCPA Compliance Check"
Conditions:
  - lead.consent_to_call == true
  - lead.consent_timestamp != null
  - lead.consent_method in ['web_form', 'phone_verification', 'written']
  - days_between(lead.consent_timestamp, now()) <= 30

// GDPR compliance validation
Rule: "GDPR Data Processing Compliance"
Conditions:
  - lead.data_processing_consent == true
  - lead.privacy_policy_accepted == true
  - lead.consent_withdrawal_method != null
  - lead.data_retention_period <= 730  // 2 years max
```

### Quality Scoring and Enhancement

**Composite Quality Score Calculation:**
```javascript
// Lead quality scoring algorithm
lead.quality_score = calculate_composite_quality_score({
  email_quality: email_quality_score(lead.email) * 0.25,
  phone_quality: phone_quality_score(lead.phone) * 0.25,
  address_quality: address_quality_score(lead.address) * 0.20,
  data_completeness: data_completeness_score(lead) * 0.15,
  consistency_score: cross_field_consistency_score(lead) * 0.10,
  external_validation: external_validation_score(lead) * 0.05
})

// Quality tier assignment based on composite score
lead.quality_tier = assign_quality_tier(lead.quality_score)
// 0.9-1.0 -> "Premium", 0.7-0.89 -> "Standard", 0.5-0.69 -> "Basic", <0.5 -> "Review"
```

**Enhancement Recommendation Engine:**
```javascript
// Data enhancement recommendations
lead.enhancement_recommendations = generate_enhancement_recommendations({
  missing_fields: identify_missing_critical_fields(lead),
  validation_failures: collect_validation_failures(lead),
  quality_improvements: suggest_quality_improvements(lead),
  external_enrichment: identify_enrichment_opportunities(lead)
})

// Automatic enhancement execution
if (lead.enhancement_auto_approve == true) {
  execute_approved_enhancements(lead, lead.enhancement_recommendations)
}
```

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Validation Failure Management

**Comprehensive Error Processing:**
```javascript
// Validation error categorization and handling
validation_results = {
  critical_errors: [],    // Errors that prevent processing
  warnings: [],          // Issues that should be reviewed
  enhancements: [],      // Suggested improvements
  auto_corrections: []   // Automatic fixes applied
}

// Error severity classification
classify_validation_error = function(error) {
  if (error.type == 'required_field_missing') return 'critical'
  if (error.type == 'format_invalid') return 'critical'
  if (error.type == 'business_rule_violation') return 'critical'
  if (error.type == 'quality_below_threshold') return 'warning'
  if (error.type == 'enhancement_available') return 'enhancement'
  return 'warning'
}

// Automatic correction application
apply_auto_corrections = function(lead, corrections) {
  for (correction in corrections) {
    if (correction.confidence >= 0.95 && correction.auto_approve == true) {
      apply_correction(lead, correction)
      log_correction_applied(lead, correction)
    }
  }
}
```

**Graceful Degradation Strategies:**
```javascript
// Progressive validation with fallback options
progressive_validation = function(lead) {
  // Level 1: Critical validation only
  critical_result = validate_critical_fields(lead)
  if (!critical_result.passed) {
    return {status: 'rejected', reason: 'critical_validation_failure'}
  }
  
  // Level 2: Business rule validation
  business_result = validate_business_rules(lead)
  if (!business_result.passed && business_result.severity == 'critical') {
    return {status: 'manual_review', reason: 'business_rule_failure'}
  }
  
  // Level 3: Quality validation
  quality_result = validate_quality_standards(lead)
  lead.quality_warnings = quality_result.warnings
  
  // Level 4: Enhancement opportunities
  enhancement_result = identify_enhancements(lead)
  lead.enhancement_opportunities = enhancement_result.recommendations
  
  return {status: 'accepted', quality_tier: determine_quality_tier(lead)}
}
```
