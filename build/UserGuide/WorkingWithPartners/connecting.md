# Connecting with Partners

## Overview

LeadConduit's partner connection system enables seamless collaboration between account holders, allowing businesses to efficiently exchange leads and work together within the platform. The Connections feature transforms how partners integrate, moving from manual webhook configurations to streamlined account-to-account relationships that enhance both operational efficiency and data security.

Partner connections in LeadConduit create bidirectional relationships where connected accounts can serve as sources in each other's flows. This system eliminates complex API integrations while maintaining the flexibility and control that sophisticated lead operations require. Whether you're working with lead vendors, buyers, or strategic partners, the connection system provides a unified approach to multi-party lead workflows.

## Understanding Partner Connections

### What Are Partner Connections?

Partner connections are authenticated relationships between LeadConduit accounts that enable automatic lead exchange. When your account connects with a partner account, several capabilities become available:

- **Mutual Source Access**: Connected partners appear as available sources in your flow configurations
- **Automatic Documentation**: Submission instructions are instantly available to connected partners
- **Secure Authentication**: Lead exchanges occur through authenticated channels without exposing sensitive webhook URLs
- **Centralized Management**: All partner relationships are managed from the Accounts Dashboard

### Connection Types and Relationships

The LeadConduit platform supports different types of partner relationships through its connection system:

**Account Sources**: Connected partners that send leads to your flows. These appear as "Account" type sources and provide the same functionality as traditional webhook sources while offering enhanced security and simpler setup.

**Buyer Connections**: Partners who receive leads from your flows through the Buyer Step feature. This connection type enables lead delivery without requiring the buyer to configure complex CRM integrations.

**Bidirectional Partners**: Accounts that function as both sources and recipients, enabling complex multi-party workflows where partners exchange leads in both directions.

## Inviting Partners to Connect

### Initiating Connection Invitations

The connection process begins with sending an invitation to a partner account. This invitation-based system ensures that connections are established only with explicit consent from both parties.

To invite a partner to connect:

1. **Access Account Management**: Navigate to the Accounts Dashboard in your LeadConduit interface
2. **Locate Connection Controls**: Find the connections management section, which displays current connections and pending invitations
3. **Send Invitation**: Use the invitation interface to send a connection request to the partner's LeadConduit account
4. **Specify Relationship Type**: Define whether this connection is for receiving leads, sending leads, or both

### Best Practices for Connection Invitations

**Clear Communication**: Before sending a connection invitation, coordinate with your partner to ensure they understand the purpose and scope of the connection. This prevents confusion and expedites the acceptance process.

**Account Verification**: Verify that you're sending the invitation to the correct LeadConduit account. Account names and contact information should match your business records to avoid connecting with unintended recipients.

**Relationship Definition**: Clearly define the expected relationship type. Whether the partner will serve as a source, recipient, or both directions affects how the connection will be configured and used.

**Timeline Expectations**: Connection invitations have expiration periods. Coordinate with partners to ensure timely acceptance of invitations to avoid the need for re-sending.

## Accepting and Managing Connection Invitations

### Accepting Incoming Invitations

When your account receives a connection invitation, the acceptance process involves several important considerations:

**Invitation Review**: Examine the invitation details carefully, including the inviting account information and the proposed relationship type. Verify that the invitation aligns with your business relationship and integration plans.

**Account Verification**: Confirm that the invitation comes from the expected partner account. This verification step is crucial for maintaining security and preventing unauthorized connections.

**Acceptance Process**: Use the LeadConduit interface to formally accept the connection invitation. This action establishes the bidirectional relationship and makes the accounts available as sources to each other.

### Managing Active Connections

Once connections are established, ongoing management ensures that partner relationships remain current and secure:

**Connection Monitoring**: Regularly review your active connections from the Accounts Dashboard. This includes verifying that connections are still necessary and that partner accounts remain active and secure.

**Access Control**: Monitor how connected partners are using their source access to your flows. Review submission patterns and volumes to ensure they align with business agreements and expectations.

**Connection Lifecycle**: Understand that connections can be modified or terminated as business relationships evolve. Plan for connection management as part of your broader partner relationship strategy.

## Buyer Step Integration

### Understanding Buyer Steps

The Buyer Step feature represents a specialized form of partner connection designed for lead delivery scenarios. This feature allows sellers to deliver leads to buyers without requiring complex CRM configurations on the buyer's side.

**Delivery Mechanism**: Buyer Steps function as specialized flow steps that route leads to connected buyer accounts. This approach simplifies lead delivery while maintaining the flexibility of LeadConduit's routing and filtering capabilities.

**Account Requirements**: Buyer Steps can connect with both free and paid LeadConduit accounts, with different capabilities available based on the buyer's subscription level.

### Configuring Buyer Step Connections

When implementing Buyer Steps in your flows:

**Partner Selection**: Choose from existing connected partners or initiate new connections directly from the Buyer Step configuration interface. This streamlined approach enables rapid partner onboarding.

**Flow Integration**: Buyer Steps integrate seamlessly with LeadConduit's existing flow logic, including acceptance criteria, field mappings, and routing rules. This ensures that lead delivery to partners maintains the same quality and control standards as other flow destinations.

**Delivery Confirmation**: Monitor delivery success and failure rates through standard LeadConduit reporting mechanisms. This visibility enables proactive management of partner relationships and delivery quality.

### Partner Account Creation and Configuration

When inviting new buyers through Buyer Steps, the system accommodates different partner scenarios:

**New Account Creation**: Partners without existing LeadConduit accounts can create accounts as part of the connection process. The platform guides new users through account setup and initial configuration.

**Free vs. Paid Accounts**: Partners can connect using free LeadConduit accounts, which provide basic lead receiving capabilities. Paid accounts offer additional features like lead filtering and rejection capabilities.

**Flow Assignment**: Connected buyers with paid subscriptions can route incoming leads to specific flows, enabling sophisticated lead processing and distribution on the buyer side.

## Security and Access Control

### Connection Security Model

LeadConduit's connection system implements multiple security layers to protect partner relationships and lead data:

**Authentication**: All connected partner interactions occur through authenticated channels, eliminating the security risks associated with exposing webhook URLs to external partners.

**Authorization**: Connection invitations require explicit acceptance from both parties, ensuring that access is granted only to intended partners.

**Scope Limitation**: Partner connections provide access only to specific functionalities (source access, buyer delivery) rather than broad account access, maintaining principle of least privilege.

### Managing Partner Access

**Connection Auditing**: Track connection establishment, usage patterns, and any changes to connection status. This audit trail supports compliance requirements and security monitoring.

**Access Revocation**: Connections can be terminated when business relationships end or security concerns arise. Revocation immediately removes partner access to account resources.

**Regular Review**: Implement periodic reviews of active connections to ensure they remain necessary and align with current business relationships and security policies.

## Troubleshooting Common Connection Issues

### Connection Invitation Problems

**Invitation Not Received**: Verify that the partner account email and contact information are correct. Check spam filters and ensure that invitations aren't being blocked by email security systems.

**Invitation Expired**: Connection invitations have limited validity periods. If invitations expire, they must be re-sent through the standard invitation process.

**Account Identification Issues**: Ensure that partner accounts are identified correctly. Account names and contact information must match to establish successful connections.

### Post-Connection Issues

**Source Not Appearing**: If a connected partner doesn't appear as an available source, verify that the connection is active and that both accounts have confirmed the relationship.

**Submission Document Access**: Connected partners should automatically receive access to submission documents. If partners report access issues, verify the connection status and re-send submission documentation if necessary.

**Delivery Failures**: For Buyer Step connections, monitor delivery success rates and investigate failures. Common causes include partner account configuration issues or flow acceptance criteria problems.

## Best Practices for Partner Connections

### Strategic Connection Management

**Relationship Documentation**: Maintain records of partner connections, including business purpose, expected volumes, and key contact information. This documentation supports operational continuity and troubleshooting.

**Capacity Planning**: Consider the volume implications of partner connections when planning flow capacity and processing resources. Partner connections can significantly impact lead volumes.

**Performance Monitoring**: Track key metrics for partner connections, including delivery success rates, processing times, and volume patterns. This data informs relationship management and optimization efforts.

### Operational Excellence

**Partner Onboarding**: Develop standardized processes for partner connection setup, including verification procedures, testing protocols, and documentation requirements.

**Change Management**: Implement procedures for modifying or terminating partner connections, including notification requirements and transition planning.

**Support and Training**: Provide partners with access to documentation, training materials, and support resources to ensure successful connection utilization.

The partner connection system in LeadConduit represents a significant advancement in multi-party lead workflow management. By leveraging these capabilities effectively, organizations can build sophisticated partner networks that enhance lead quality, expand market reach, and improve operational efficiency while maintaining the security and control that enterprise lead operations require.
