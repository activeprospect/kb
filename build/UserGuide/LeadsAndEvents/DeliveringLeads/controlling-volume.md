## Rate Limiting Configuration

### Time-Based Rate Limits

**Rate Limit Granularity:**
```
Rate Limit Examples:
├── Per Second: 10 leads/second
├── Per Minute: 100 leads/minute
├── Per Hour: 1,000 leads/hour
├── Per Day: 10,000 leads/day
└── Per Month: 250,000 leads/month
```

**Implementation Strategies:**
- **Token Bucket:** Allow burst capacity with sustained rate
- **Fixed Window:** Reset counters at fixed intervals
- **Sliding Window:** Maintain rolling time window average
- **Leaky Bucket:** Smooth output rate regardless of input

**Rate Limit Configuration:**
```
Rate Limit Setup:
├── Limit: 100 leads per hour
├── Window: Rolling 60-minute window
├── Burst: Allow 20-lead burst above rate
├── Reset: Continuous sliding window
└── Overflow: Queue or reject excess leads
```

### Adaptive Rate Limiting

**Dynamic Rate Adjustment:**
- Adjust rates based on recipient system performance
- Increase rates during optimal performance periods
- Reduce rates during high error or timeout conditions
- Implement circuit breaker patterns for system protection

**Performance-Based Scaling:**
```
Adaptive Rate Examples:
├── Success Rate > 95%: Increase rate by 10%
├── Success Rate < 90%: Decrease rate by 20%
├── Response Time > 5s: Reduce rate by 15%
├── Error Rate > 5%: Trigger circuit breaker
└── System Recovery: Gradual rate restoration
```

**Business Hour Optimization:**
- Higher rates during business hours

├── Business Days: 1,500 leads Monday-Friday only
├── Tiered: 500 high-value + 2,000 standard leads
├── Seasonal: Higher limits during peak seasons
└── Emergency: Temporary limit adjustments
```

### Weekly and Monthly Caps

**Longer-Term Volume Management:**
- Weekly caps for consistent volume distribution

└── Overflow: Alternative routing or queuing
```

### Overflow Handling

**Volume Limit Exceeded Actions:**
- **Queue:** Hold excess leads for next period
- **Route:** Send to alternative recipients
- **Reject:** Return leads to source with notification
- **Defer:** Delay delivery until capacity available

**Overflow Configuration:**
```
Overflow Management:
├── Primary: Deliver up to daily cap
├── Overflow Option 1: Queue for tomorrow
├── Overflow Option 2: Route to backup recipient
├── Overflow Option 3: Return to source

├── Weighted: 70% Primary, 30% Secondary
├── Tiered: High-value to Primary, Standard to Secondary
├── Geographic: Route by state or region
└── Performance: Route to best-performing recipients
```

**Round-Robin Distribution:**
