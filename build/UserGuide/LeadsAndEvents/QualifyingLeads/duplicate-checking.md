# Duplicate Checking

Duplicate checking in LeadConduit prevents processing the same lead multiple times, protecting both buyers from paying for duplicate leads and sellers from diminishing their reputation through redundant submissions. Understanding duplicate detection strategies and implementation ensures optimal lead quality and cost management.

## Understanding Lead Duplication

### Types of Duplicate Leads

**Exact Duplicates:**
- Identical contact information across all fields
- Same source submitting identical data
- System processing errors causing resubmission
- Network timeout retries creating duplicates

**Near Duplicates:**
- Minor variations in name spelling or formatting
- Different phone number formats for same person
- Alternate email addresses for same individual
- Address variations (abbreviations, apartment numbers)

**Intentional Duplicates:**
- Same person submitting through multiple forms
- Multi-channel marketing campaign responses
- Partner networks with overlapping sources
- Consumer shopping behavior across websites

**Time-Based Duplicates:**
- Same lead submitted within specific time windows
- Rapid-fire form submissions
- Browser refresh duplicates
- Campaign-driven multiple inquiries

### Business Impact of Duplicates

**Cost Implications:**
- Buyers pay multiple times for same prospect
- Processing costs multiply unnecessarily
- Partner relationships suffer from quality issues
- Reduced campaign ROI and effectiveness

**Quality Concerns:**
- Consumer experience degradation from multiple contacts
- Compliance issues with contact frequency
- Brand reputation damage
- Reduced conversion rates

## Duplicate Detection Strategies

### Field-Based Matching

**Primary Identifier Matching:**
```
Exact Match Criteria:
├── Email address (case insensitive)
├── Phone number (normalized format)
├── First name + Last name + ZIP code
└── Address + Name combination
```

**Flexible Matching Patterns:**
```
Near-Match Criteria:
├── Name variations (Bob/Robert, Liz/Elizabeth)
├── Phone format differences (555-123-4567 vs 5551234567)
├── Email domain variations (@gmail.com vs @googlemail.com)
└── Address abbreviations (St vs Street, Apt vs #)
```

### Hash-Based Deduplication

**Composite Hash Creation:**
```
Hash Generation Strategy:
├── Normalize all comparison fields
├── Create composite string from key fields
├── Generate SHA-256 hash of composite
└── Store hash for rapid duplicate detection
```

**Hash Field Examples:**
```javascript
// Example hash composition
const hashFields = [
  lead.first_name.toLowerCase().trim(),
  lead.last_name.toLowerCase().trim(),
  lead.email.toLowerCase().trim(),
  lead.phone.replace(/\D/g, ''), // Remove non-digits
  lead.zip
].join('|');

const duplicateHash = sha256(hashFields);
```

### Time Window Deduplication

**Window-Based Strategies:**
- **Rolling Window**: Check duplicates within last N hours/days
- **Daily Reset**: Allow same lead once per day
- **Campaign Window**: Deduplicate within campaign duration
- **Custom Intervals**: Business-specific time frames

**Implementation Examples:**
```
Time-Based Rules:
├── No duplicates within 24 hours
├── Maximum 1 lead per week per email
├── Campaign-specific deduplication windows
└── Source-specific time restrictions
```

## Implementation Methods

### Filter Step Deduplication

**Filter-Based Approach:**
- Use filter steps to check for duplicates before processing
- Reject duplicate leads immediately
- Provide clear rejection reasons
- Maintain processing efficiency

**Filter Rule Example:**
```
Duplicate Check Filter:
├── Rule: {{lead.email}} has been seen in last 24 hours
├── Outcome: failure
├── Reason: "Duplicate lead detected"
└── Action: Stop processing, return failure response
```

### Enhancement Service Integration

### Custom Duplicate Logic

**Template-Based Duplicate Detection:**
```

```

**Advanced Template Logic:**
```
// Complex duplicate detection template
{{
  (lead.email.toLowerCase() == previous.email.toLowerCase()) ||
  (
    lead.phone.replace(/\D/g, '') == previous.phone.replace(/\D/g, '') &&
    lead.first_name.toLowerCase() == previous.first_name.toLowerCase() &&
    lead.last_name.toLowerCase() == previous.last_name.toLowerCase()
  )
}}
```

## Configuration Strategies

### Duplicate Matching Criteria

**Strict Matching:**
- Exact field matches required
- Case-sensitive comparisons
- No tolerance for variations
- Highest precision, lowest recall

**Flexible Matching:**
- Normalized field comparisons
- Case-insensitive matching
- Minor variation tolerance
- Balanced precision and recall

**Fuzzy Matching:**
- Similarity algorithms
- Edit distance calculations
- Phonetic matching
- Highest recall, potential false positives

### Field Selection for Matching

**Primary Fields (High Confidence):**
- Email address (unique identifier)
- Phone number (normalized)
- Social Security Number (when available)
- Customer ID or external identifier

**Secondary Fields (Supporting Evidence):**
- Full name (first + last)
- Date of birth
- Address information
- ZIP code

**Tertiary Fields (Additional Context):**
- IP address
- Browser fingerprint
- Device information
- Submission timestamp

### Time Window Configuration

**Short Windows (High Velocity):**
- 1-4 hours: Prevents immediate duplicates
- Use for high-volume campaigns
- Catches system errors and retries
- Minimal impact on legitimate resubmissions

**Medium Windows (Standard Protection):**
- 24-48 hours: Standard business day protection
- Balances duplicate prevention with legitimate inquiries
- Accommodates consumer shopping behavior
- Industry standard for most campaigns

**Long Windows (Comprehensive Protection):**
- 7-30 days: Extensive duplicate prevention
- Appropriate for high-value leads
- Protects against extended shopping periods
- May impact legitimate repeat inquiries

## Advanced Duplicate Detection

### Multi-Dimensional Matching

**Hierarchical Duplicate Detection:**
```
Duplicate Detection Hierarchy:
├── Level 1: Exact email match (99% confidence)
├── Level 2: Phone + name match (95% confidence)
├── Level 3: Name + address match (90% confidence)
├── Level 4: Fuzzy name + contact match (85% confidence)
└── Level 5: Behavioral pattern match (80% confidence)
```

**Confidence Scoring:**
- Assign confidence scores to duplicate matches
- Allow business rules based on confidence levels
- Enable manual review for uncertain matches
- Improve accuracy through machine learning

### Cross-Source Deduplication

**Global Duplicate Prevention:**
- Check duplicates across all sources
- Prevent cross-campaign duplicates
- Maintain master duplicate database
- Enable source-specific overrides

**Source Priority Management:**
```
Source Priority Handling:

├── Direct sources override affiliate sources
├── Recent submissions override older ones
└── Higher-quality sources take precedence
```

### Behavioral Duplicate Detection

**Pattern Recognition:**
