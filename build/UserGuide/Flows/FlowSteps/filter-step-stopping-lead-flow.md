# Filter Step (Stopping Lead Flow)

Filter steps in LeadConduit provide powerful lead qualification and flow control capabilities by evaluating business rules and stopping lead processing when specific criteria are not met. These steps enable quality control, compliance management, and strategic lead routing through intelligent filtering logic.

## Filter Step Overview

### Purpose of Filter Steps

**Quality Control:**
- Implement lead qualification criteria and standards
- Filter out low-quality or inappropriate leads
- Maintain consistent quality standards across flows
- Protect downstream recipients from poor-quality leads

**Compliance Management:**
- Enforce regulatory and legal compliance requirements
- Implement consent and permission validation
- Support industry-specific compliance standards
- Maintain audit trails for regulatory reporting

**Business Logic Implementation:**
- Apply complex business rules and qualification criteria
- Implement market-specific or product-specific filtering
- Support strategic lead routing and distribution
- Enable data-driven lead processing decisions
