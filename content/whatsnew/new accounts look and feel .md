### New Accounts Look and Feel!

You may notice a bit of a change around here...we have updated the look and feel of your account to match the other ActiveProspect products. You will now see main account features nested in the left side panel. All the same functionality exists, we just reorganized it to make it clearer to find what you need.

**Are you an enterprise customer looking for** [Volume Tracking](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4870822-volume-tracking) **?**Don't worry, simply select Billing on the left side panel to check the status of your current volume.

**Looking to invite a colleague to your account?**
Select User Management, then Invite New Member.

**Need your API Key?**
Select Settings, then Technical to copy your API key

With this update, there is a new url to access your account (https://account.activeprospect.com). This means that all traffic to any sso.activeprospect.com url will automatically redirect to the new account.activeprospect.com experience.
Feel free to bookmark for easy access!

We know change can be hard, but thanks for adapting to the new experience.
