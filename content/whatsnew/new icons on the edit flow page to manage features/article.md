### New Icons on the Edit Flow page to Manage Features

_There are a few new icons you may notice when editing your Flow._

\- The Gavel icon allows you to configure Real-time Bidding (Ping/Post) on the flow.

\- The Shield icon will indicate if TrustedForm Data is being used on your Acceptance Criteria, Volume Caps or Pricing on the flow.

These features must be enabled on your account prior to use. Reach out to your client success manager for more information.
