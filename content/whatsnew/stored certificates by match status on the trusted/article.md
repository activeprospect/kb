### Stored Certificates by Match Status on the TrustedForm Dashboard

Have you been using [TrustedForm's lead matching feature](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4766190-trustedform-fingerprint-lead-matching) to ensure that your 3rd party leads have been providing the correct TrustedForm certificate with them? If not, you are leaving your business susceptible to lead fraud, mistakes and more!

Use the [TrustedForm Dashboard](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4560120-trustedform-dashboard) to assess your usage of this feature and the results you are getting. You can see how many of your stored certificates fall into each of the possible match statuses each month. Gauge the impact of potentially filtering out leads that don't matched or other business strategies. Take a look at the homepage of the TrustedForm application and start learning more about your leads!
