### TrustedForm's Enhanced PII Protection

TrustedForm was created to build trust and transparency between buyers and sellers of internet leads. As we maintain that transparency we also remain committed to protecting the sensitive data that is handled in the process. In order to further support that, TrustedForm certificates now hide all form input data by default until [the certificate has been matched with lead data](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4766190-trustedform-lead-matching) to ensure that PII and other sensitive information is only made available to parties that already have access to it.

This change highlights the importance and encourages the best practice of lead matching to protect everyone involved in the lead generation process against mistake or bad actors. It also makes TrustedForm certificates suitable for ping/post lead distribution so that they can be passed to potential buyers to gain more information about the lead event without exposing information that can be used to contact or identify the lead. For lead publishers/vendors this means your process just became easier as you don't have to pass a different URL on the ping anymore!

If you view a TrustedForm certificate and are prompted to [perform lead matching](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5021187-lead-matching-when-viewing-a-trustedform-certificate), simply enter the email or phone number input during the lead event and the form input values will be revealed to you the same as they have always been. Make sure to automate this process in the your flows by perform lead matching in your API requests when you store certificates. If you run into any issues contact our support team and they will be happy to help.

Don't know if you're already performing lead matching? Check the [Stored Certificate by Match Status card on the TrustedForm Dashboard](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4932869-stored-certificates-by-match-status-on-the-trustedform-dashboard). This will show you how many of your recent certificate were matched with leads or not.
