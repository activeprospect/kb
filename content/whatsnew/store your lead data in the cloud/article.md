### Store Your Lead Data in the Cloud

LeadConduit’s new Firehose feature gives you an easy way to connect your lead flows to [Amazon Web Services Simple Storage Service](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/?nc2=h_ql_prod_fs_s3) (S3). Once enabled, Firehose streams lead data directly to S3 where you can store data as long as you’d like and perform powerful queries for predictive analysis.

Access the gear icon within the step editor and start sending lead data to S3 today!
