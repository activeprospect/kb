### TrustedForm Verify: New form\_submitted Field Now Available

We're excited to introduce the new **`form_submitted`** field in the TrustedForm Verify API response! This boolean field indicates whether a form was successfully submitted ( `true`) or abandoned before submission ( `false`).

Included in every Verify request, the `form_submitted` field provides a programmatic way to detect and verify form submissions, offering clear insights into form activity and giving lead buyers greater confidence in their data. This update also supports features like extended retention windows for submitted leads.

We’ve updated our [community post](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5549726-trustedform-verify-introducing-form-submit) and [TrustedForm API documentation](https://developers.activeprospect.com/docs/trustedform/api/v4.0/tag/Verify/) with more details about this feature—be sure to check it out!
