### Drill down on stats in any report

LeadConduit's new reporting drill-down feature brings the numbers in your reporting table to life by providing clickable stats within the rows of your report.

Drilling down into the individual lead details makes it easy to investigate leads submitted without TrustedForm certificates or scan a list of leads from Texas that were rejected as duplicates last week.

Whether you’re troubleshooting or optimizing, reporting drill-down gives you the granularity you need when you need it.

Visit your [reporting page](https://next.leadconduit.com/reports) and start drilling down today!
