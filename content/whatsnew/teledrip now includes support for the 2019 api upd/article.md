### Teledrip now includes support for the 2019 API updates

Earlier this year Teledrip released updates to their API and now our Teledrip integration brings all those features to you including:

- **AB** \- The A/B Test id for split testing campaigns.
- **Transfer Number** \- A phone number to override the transfer destination on basic and advanced calls
- **Cost** \- The cost of the lead. If provided, this information will be used in the Teledrip ROI Report to provide more accurate costs.
- **IP Address** \- When a TrustedForm certificate is claimed, the IP from the certificate is provided, otherwise the vendor-provided IP will be used.
