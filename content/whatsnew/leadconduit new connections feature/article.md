### LeadConduit: New Connections Feature

We’re excited to announce a new update that allows you to connect your account with your partners accounts within ActiveProspect. When your account is connected to your partners account, you will see them available as a source to add to any of your flows. Upon adding your connected partner as a source in one of your flows, their submission documents to send leads to your flow will instantly be available in their account. You can track your accounts connections and pending invites from the Accounts Dashboard.

This [article](https://community.activeprospect.com/series/5554657) explains everything you need to know about how you add a connected partner in LeadConduit as a source.
