### LeadConduit Release Notes

- Branding has been updated for emails
- The Sources page will only show Sources that you have added to flows, rather than all Sources in the AP network
- The Recipients page will only show Recipient that you have added to flows, rather than all Recipients in the AP network
- Both Standard Sources and Standard Recipients can now be removed from the respective pages, this does not delete them from the network.
- Fixed issue where the left-hard side navigation bar would show up on the lead import page
