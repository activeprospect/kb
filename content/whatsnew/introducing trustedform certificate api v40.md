### Introducing TrustedForm Certificate API v4.0

TrustedForm Certificate API v4.0 is the latest and recommended version when using the TrustedForm product offering. It offers a more organized request & response structure that is extensible to accommodate new products in the future. It also offers discounted pricing for storing certificates you generated and protection against making duplicate requests.

As part of this version upgrade, TrustedForm Consent has been replaced with TrustedForm Retain. Retain is our newest product that is streamlined for retaining certificates and has a name to match. It is important to remember that having a TrustedForm certificate is not the same as having prior express written consent. You must examine how your leads are being generated to ensure that consent is properly obtained during the process. For this reason, Retain is more appropriate product name.

Self-service customers should read [TrustedForm Self Service: How to use API version 4.0](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5098113-trustedform-self-service-how-to-use-api-version-4-0) for instructions to use the new version.

Managed customers should wait for your customer success manager to reach out to you about upgrading.
