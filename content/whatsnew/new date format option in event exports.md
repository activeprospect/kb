### New Date Format Option in Event Exports

Based on a bunch of feedback from our clients, we've introduced a new option for how dates are formatted during event exports. This new ""yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss"" format is recognized as a ""date/time"" object by spreadsheet applications, allowing you to easily reformat the date into whatever format you need - whether you need just the year for someone's age, just need the date and not the time, etc.

This new format is now the default, but you can deselect the toggle to use the older format.
