### ""Lookback Period"" added to SuppressionList in Enhanced Real-time Bidding

**Our SuppressionList in Enhanced Real-time Bidding capability has been updated to provide you more control over how you check your lists!**

Now, if you want to disregard more recent matches, you can optionally set a ""lookback period"". For example, if you'd like to only consider a record a ""duplicate"" if they were added within the last 30 days, you'd select ""30"", and ""Days"" as shown in the documentation linked below.

Note that this works _independently_ of SuppressionList's ""auto pruning"" functionality, allowing you to fine-tune your checks without compromising the integrity of your lists.
