### New in TrustedForm Verify: Enhanced Compliance Checks

Programmatically validate font size, contrast ratio, and opt-in method, before contacting a lead.

We’ve added three new automated checks to TrustedForm Verify, to help lead buyers enforce consent standards with confidence.

These checks support compliance with the 'clear and conspicuous' consent requirements under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and related standards.

Here’s what each check does:

- **Font Size Check** – Verifies that the consent language shown to each lead meets a minimum font size, ensuring it’s easy to read. [Learn more](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5561944-coming-soon-trustedform-verify-font-size-check)

- **Contrast Ratio Check** – Confirms that consent text stands out clearly against its background for better visibility. [Learn more](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5561943-coming-soon-trustedform-verify-contrast-ratio-check)

- **Opt-in Type Check** – Verifies that each lead opted in using an allowed method, helping you enforce your consent standards. [Learn more](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5619028-coming-soon-trustedform-verify-opt-in-type-check)


These safeguards help protect your brand, reduce regulatory exposure, and improve lead quality. TrustedForm Verify now lets you apply these standards automatically, helping reduce legal risk and ensure every lead meets your compliance criteria before contact.
