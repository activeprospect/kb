### TrustedForm Facebook Certificate Claims Impacted

Claims made for TrustedForm certificates that originated from Facebook Lead Ads between 11:15am CST and 12:53pm CST saw an abnormally high error rate that caused some requests to receive an unexpected error. If you experienced any errors while trying to claim certificates during this time we recommend that you retry your requests now. Any failed attempts to claim using LeadConduit(powered by ActiveProspect) during this period will be automatically resubmitted.

We apologize for any inconvenience this caused and thank you for your patience.
