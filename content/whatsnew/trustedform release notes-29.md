### TrustedForm Release Notes

- Improved the accuracy of clicks shown in session replays. Different browsers render web pages differently which made it possible for the location of clicks to be slightly off in session replays. We have updated our display logic to protect against these differences to make the re-enactment shown in session replay even more reliable!
