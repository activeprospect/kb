### Improved Management of Unreviewed Consent Languages

The [Consent Language Manager](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474006-trustedform-consent-language-manager) under TrustedForm Verify helps you track and manage variations of consent language shown to your leads. New variations appear in the Unreviewed tab, where you can approve or reject them for future use.

To help you better manage consent language variations, weâ€™re updating how newly autogenerated unreviewed templates are created. Going forward, phone numbers and email addresses will be replaced with placeholders instead of actual values, with **{{phone}}** for phone numbers and **{{email}}** for email addresses.

This change prevents unnecessary template duplication due to minor variations, making it easier to review and manage consent languages efficiently.

You can use these placeholders along with wildcards when creating approved consent language templates to group similar variations together and reduce clutter. For more details on how to use placeholders and wildcards effectively, check out our updated [community post](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5448162-manually-add-approved-language-to-trustedform-verify-consent-language-manager).

As a reminder, there is a limit of 1,000 unreviewed consent language templates. Be sure to review and approve or reject them regularly to keep your list manageable.
