### External Pricing Service

External Pricing Service is an option within Enhanced Real-time Bidding’s Pricing module to enable a flow to use the price returned by a call to an external API. This functionality enables you to use 3rd party or in-house functionality via our “Custom Integration” enhancement instead of relying on LeadConduit’s rules-based pricing module. Thank you to all the @lc-team for all your hard work!!
