Announcement
November 20, 2023

### New Pending Users Feature

In the User Management section of your account you'll see a new tab for ""Pending Users"".

We have added extra validation to prevent your coworkers from creating duplicate ActiveProspect accounts. If someone from your company tries to create a new account, they'll now be prompted to request access to join your already existing account. When they do that, you'll receive an email and be able to see the requestor in the Pending Users section. From there you'll be able to accept or reject the request.
