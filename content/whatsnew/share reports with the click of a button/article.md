### Share Reports with the Click of a Button!

Ever wish you could share your reports with a lead partner or colleague? With LeadConduit’s new shared reporting feature - you can!

Shared reporting lets you generate a unique URL for any report in your account. Just copy, paste, and share that URL with anyone you’d like to give access. There's no need to log in to see the report, so you can confidently curate insights for non-account holders and start sharing with the click of a button.

Need to revoke access to a report? You can do that too! Visit the **[reports page](https://next.leadconduit.com/reports)** and give it a try.
