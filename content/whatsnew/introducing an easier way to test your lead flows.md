### Introducing an Easier Way to Test Your Lead Flows

LeadConduit now gives you the power to test your lead flows without having to leave the app!

Whether you’re a first-time flow creator or a seasoned vet, testing your flow is a critical part of the “go-live” process. LeadConduit's new testing tool makes this process easier by providing a pre-populated test form accessible from anywhere within the flow editor.

If you’re confident in your flow’s configuration but need an easy way to submit leads manually, you can use the tool for that too!

Click the **Test Your Flow** button within the sources, fields, or step editor to get started.
