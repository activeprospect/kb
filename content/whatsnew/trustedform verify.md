### TrustedForm Verify

Today we introduce the newest product offering in the TrustedForm family!

Verify gives you the tools you need to assure yourself that leads you have purchased have given meaningful consent to be contacted. Purchased leads often originate from hundreds or even thousands of different sources. As a marketer it is your job to make sure you only reach out to leads that were generated in a compliant manner to protect your business from unnecessary violations, litigation and poor consumer experiences that hurt your reputation.

When you view the Verify section of the TrustedForm application you will be taken to your Consent Language Manager. Here you will see all the different variations of consent languages used to generate the leads you purchased. Have your compliance team review them and approve all the ones that meet their requirements while rejecting the ones that donâ€™t. Then simply use the verify operation within the TrustedForm Certificate API for all the new leads you plan to purchase and the result will tell you whether you should accept it or not.

Expand your compliance assessment and make sure you only purchase leads with meaningful consent using TrustedForm Verify!
