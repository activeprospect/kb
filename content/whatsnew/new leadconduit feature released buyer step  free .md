### New LeadConduit Feature Released: Buyer Step & Free Buyer Accounts

The Buyer Step allows a paid LeadConduit user to deliver leads to their buyer without having to configure a delivery to the buyers CRM. They simply add a Buyer Step in their flow and can either have it deliver to a partner they have already connected with or invite a new Buyer.

- If the Buyer does not have an account with ActiveProspect or has an account but does not have a subscription to LeadConduit, they will be prompted to create one and configure a delivery to their own CRM. This account is free but does not allow them to filter and reject leads.
- If the Buyer has a paid subscription to LeadConduit, they will be asked which flow they want to add this new source to so they can receive leads from their seller.
