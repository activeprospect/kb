### New Integration! Phone Lookup by Twilio

LeadConduit now offers Phone Lookup by Twilio.

Using the phone number, Twilio returns the Caller ID Name and Carrier information, including whether it's a landline, mobile, or VoIP number and if the number is for a business or consumer.

All this data makes it easy for you to cross-reference the information provided by the lead source and check for inconsistencies.
