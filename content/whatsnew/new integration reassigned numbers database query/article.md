### New Integration! Reassigned Numbers Database: Query

The Reassigned Numbers Database: Query integration allows you to ensure you’re contacting the right customer with the Reassigned Numbers Database.

This integration allows you to query the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC’s) reassigned number information to determine whether a telephone number has been permanently disconnected from an intended consumer.

Check out Reassigned Numbers Database: Query in our [community post](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4588233-reassigned-numbers-database-query) and [integration catalog](https://activeprospect.com/integrations/reassigned-numbers-database/query/) for more details!
