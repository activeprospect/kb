### View TrustedForm certificates from your verified domains

Now that ActiveProspect offers a way for you to [verify domain ownership](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4649879-verify-domain-ownership) there are many new features and improvements to your experience that we would love for you to take advantage of!

Today we make it much easier to view the certificates generated for leads you have certified using the TrustedForm Web Script. Simply verify the domain(s) where you add the script and your account will be able to view the certificates that originate from it for as long as they are available. This means you can use the same configuration for testing and production and view the result at no cost to ensure that your content is being captured accurately in your TrustedForm certificates.
