### New Integration! TrustedForm: Consent

The TrustedForm: Consent integration allows you to document consent in TrustedForm certificates for legal (TCPA) compliance.

This integration makes it easier than ever to store TrustedForm certificates using LeadConduit as it is streamlined to focus only on the necessities to verify consent and protect your business.

Check out TrustedForm: Consent in our [community post](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4552827-trustedform-consent) and [integration catalog](https://activeprospect.com/integrations/trustedform/consent/) for more details!
