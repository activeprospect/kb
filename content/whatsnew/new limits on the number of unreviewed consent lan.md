### New limits on the number of unreviewed consent languages

The [Consent Language Manager](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5474006-trustedform-consent-language-manager) in the Verify section of TrustedForm helps you organize and track variations of consent language shown to your leads. New variations appear in the _Unreviewed_ tab, where you can decide to approve or reject them for future use.

We’ve noticed that for some customers, this section can grow too large, which may affect the performance of certain features. To address this, we’re introducing a limit of 1,000 consent languages in the _Unreviewed_ tab. Once this limit is reached, new variations will stop populating until the existing ones are reviewed.

If you hit this limit, be sure to review your consent languages to make room. You can also use wildcards to group similar languages together and reduce clutter. We're working on additional updates to make the review process even smoother—stay tuned!
