### New data security enhancement limiting access to TrustedForm Certificate session replays

Beginning July 5, 2023, new TrustedForm certificates will, by default, hide all form input data in session replays to protect against any possible unauthorized access of the Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of consumers. Note: All TrustedForm Certificates created prior to this update will have no change.

With this change, the full session replays (with form inputs) will only be viewable by users who have demonstrated that they already have access to the PII in the session replay. This enhancement ensures that consumer data cannot be accessed through the TrustedForm Certificate by any party who doesnâ€™t already have access to the consumer data. This new data protection is achieved without compromising the current session replay functionality of TrustedForm.
