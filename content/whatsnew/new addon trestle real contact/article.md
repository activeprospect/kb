### New Add-On! Trestle: Real Contact

From just a phone number input, this Add-On validates whether a lead is real, confirms the person is who they say they are, and grades the contactability of the lead.

This service allows you to _Prioritize leads_ with the best chance of contactability based on if the number is connected or disconnected, reachable or a temporary number, and belongs to the person who they say they are; and _Reach your target audience_ by managing your business phone reputation and avoiding outgoing calls to disconnected and temporary numbers.

Check it out in our [community post](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5085429) and [add-ons catalog](https://activeprospect.com/add-on-services/trestle/real_contact/) for more details!
