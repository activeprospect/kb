### TrustedForm Verify's 1:1 Consent Check is available!

Stay ahead of regulations and avoid fines—make Verify’s 1:1 Consent Check part of your compliance process.

We’re excited to introduce the 1:1 Consent Check, a new feature in TrustedForm's Verify product offering, designed for advertisers who purchase leads and contact consumers. In response to the FCC’s new rule requiring advertisers to obtainconsent from consumers in a one-to-one manner, 1:1 Consent Check allows you to programmatically verify that each consumer has specifically consented to be contacted by your business, helping you confirm your vendors have complied with these updated regulations. This feature mitigates the risk of non-compliance, fines, or legal issues, providing peace of mind as you continue to scale your business. Safeguard your outreach efforts by the 1:1 Consent Check to your lead processing today!
