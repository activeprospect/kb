### Data Capture for Android Users of TrustedForm

This morning we detected a sudden issue preventing TrustedForm certificates from being generated for consumers using an Android operating system. Since then the issue has been resolved and have found the root cause to be a change made by Amazon Web Services (AWS), our cloud services provider, to a security feature meant to block malicious database attacks. The impact of this change prevented the creation of TrustedForm Certificates by Android users from approximately 08:00 - 15:55 UTC.

To mitigate incidents like this from happening in the future we are adding monitors to alert us of anomalous changes in our firewall traffic. If you have any questions regarding yesterdayâ€™s outage, please reach out to your Client Services representative.
