### Forensiq by Impact

LeadConduit now offers an integration with Forensiq by Impact.

Forensiq uses machine-learning and advanced bot fingerprinting to identify and block ad fraud so you can eliminate costly, ineffectual marketing spend and keep your data clean.

Combined with TrustedForm, which independently verifies the origin and authenticity of internet leads, Forensiq receives the most reliable data possible to make informed determinations about fraud.

**BYOC:** To provide the best of both worlds, LeadConduit's Forensiq integration allows clients to Bring Your Own Credentials so you're able to access dashboards and reports based only on your lead flows.
