### Importing from the Leads View

We've made it easier to upload leads from your CSV files!

To get started, navigate to the new leads view and select the **Import Leads** button in the top right of your screen. Choose the flow and source you want to associate with these leads and we'll take you directly to the lead import wizard where you can make any last-minute adjustments before importing your file.
