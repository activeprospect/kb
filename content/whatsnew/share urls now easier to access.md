### Share URLs: Now Easier to Access!

We’ve made it easier to access Share URLs. Previously, Share URLs were hidden in the Certificate History tab, making them hard to find. To improve accessibility, the Share button has now been moved to the certificate header, making it quicker and simpler to share your certificates. This change will only apply to **new certificates** moving forward and will not be retroactively applied to existing ones.

**Share URLs** allow customers to share certificates with other parties without requiring authentication. This feature is often used when sharing certificates in the event of a complaint or litigation, allowing legal teams, judges, or other parties who may not be members of the customer’s account to view the certificate.

Please note that Share URLs are openly viewable by any party that receives them. As such, they should be used cautiously and in accordance with best practices for sharing.
