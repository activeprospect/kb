### Save Time by Copying a Recipient Flow Step

If you have a complicated Recipient step to use in several flows, you can copy that step from one flow to another. Copying a step carries over mappings and rules saving you time and preventing inconsistencies.

**Example of copying a Recipient Step**

1\. Locate the Flow containing the Step to be copied and click Edit Flow.

2\. Locate the Recipient Step to be copied and click the Gear icon on the right side a drop down menu will open and click Copy Step.

3\. In the dialog that appears, select the target destination Flow and click Finish. Note: You can even copy the recipient to the current flow. For example if your flow to send leads to the same CRM with slightly different mappings based on rules.

4\. The target destination flow opens and the copied step appears as the last step. All field mappings, Step Criteria, and other settings will be carried over from the original step.

5\. Be sure to review this step for any fields and rules that may not apply or are different for this flow.

6\. And of course remember to Save your target destination flow to keep this copied step.
