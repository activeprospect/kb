### Validate TrustedForm Cert URL in LeadConduit Rulesets!

Our customers frequently ask for a way to quickly and easily validate that a TrustedForm certificate URL is real and not expired. And we’ve listened. LeadConduit can now inspect and validate all TrustedForm certificates instantaneously in any ruleset in LeadConduit. That means that a lead submitted with a TrustedForm certificate URL that is fabricated or points to an expired certificate can now be rejected immediately before the lead is processed.

Simply add a rule to your acceptance criteria to check that the format is valid, and LeadConduit will perform an instant deep analysis on the certificate URL, without any cost to you.
