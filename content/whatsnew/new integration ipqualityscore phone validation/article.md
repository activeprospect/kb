### New Integration! IPQualityScore: Phone Validation

The IPQualityScore: Phone Validation integration verifies phone numbers and identifies suspicious numbers in real-time with phone number reputation scores.

IPQualityScore's Phone Validation service performs carrier lookups by API in any region to detect disconnected phone numbers and retrieve important carrier info including line types to determine if a number is a VOIP, landline, mobile/wireless, or prepaid line.
