## New to TrustedForm?

ActiveProspect’s TrustedForm is the industry standard for documenting consent and certifying the authenticity of internet leads. TrustedForm captures critical data about the lead generation event so you can use that data to inform your bidding process and make the right decision about every lead you buy.

When TrustedForm generates a certificate, it also captures a wide range of information about every lead - information you can leverage as part of your LeadConduit real-time bidding workflow, such as:

- Lead age
- Geolocation
- Browser
- Device type
- Typing speed & keystroke behavior
- Time spent on form
- Originating source
