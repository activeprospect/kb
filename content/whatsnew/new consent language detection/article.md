### New Consent Language Detection!

If you are using the TrustedForm Consent product and the TrustedForm Web Script finds consent language on a web page, the certificate that is created will have a section titled ""Consent Language Detected"". This section contains text that was identified as consent language by our proprietary machine learning model. Use this to become more aware of what your leads are consenting to and get new variations approved by your legal team to remain compliant with regulations like the TCPA.
