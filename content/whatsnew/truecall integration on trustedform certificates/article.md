### TrueCall Integration on TrustedForm Certificates

We’re excited to announce a new integration that enhances the transparency and validation of your inbound calls. TrustedForm now supports the inclusion of **TrueCall IDs** in TrustedForm certificates, helping you easily verify the legitimacy of the calls you're receiving.

When a **TrueCall ID** is available, it will appear in the **Publisher Provided Data** section of the TrustedForm certificate. By clicking on the TrueCall ID, you’ll be redirected to the TrueCall platform where you can view detailed information about the call and confirm whether it was genuinely initiated by a potential customer.

TrueCall helps eliminate the risk of unauthorized outbound calls infiltrating inbound marketing campaigns, giving you more confidence in the quality of your leads.

Learn more about how to take advantage of the TrueCall integration in our **[TrueCall Integration on TrustedForm Certificates](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5571263-truecall-integration-on-trustedform-certificates)** community post!
