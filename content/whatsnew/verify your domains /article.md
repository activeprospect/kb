### Verify your Domains

As a site-owner generating TrustedForm certificates, we want to provide you insights into domain specific certificate volume and give you credit for TrustedForm certificates claimed from your domains. To do that, all you have to do is verify you are the domain owner.

Verifying your Domains is a familiar and straightforward process, go to [https://account.activeprospect.com/domains](https://account.activeprospect.com/domains) to get started

Verifying ownership of domains where you have implemented the TrustedForm Script, lets us positively verify that you created a lead associated with the TrustedForm Certificate.
