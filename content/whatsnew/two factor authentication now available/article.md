### Two Factor Authentication Now Available

Step-up your ActiveProspect account security with Two Factor Authentication (2FA).

You are probably familiar with 2FA. 2FA is an extra layer of security used to ensure when you are logging into your ActiveProspect account, you are who you say you are. Serving as a validation tool, 2FA works to provide your ActiveProspect account the security you need. First, a user will enter their username and a password. Then, instead of immediately gaining account access, they will be required to provide a custom code received in a text message.

Go to your user account settings to enable for yourself or make a request to Support@ActiveProspect.com to enable for all users on your Account.
