### Introducing the all-new ActiveProspect look and feel!

It’s an exciting day for ActiveProspect as we announce the launch of our new website, logo, and redesign of the brand’s entire look and feel! While we loved our previous branding, we wanted the new design and website messaging to properly reflect who we are, what we do, and how we do it.

The timing for our rebranding is ideal as a fresh new look, strong value proposition, and new tagline all combine to clearly articulate our mission of making consent-based marketing the best platform for customer acquisition. We hope you enjoy the new look and feel free to let us know if you have any questions.
