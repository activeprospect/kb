### TrustedForm: Extended Claims

Now the full power of TrustedForm is available to anyone buying leads up to 3 months old! When you buy leads from another TrustedForm client, ActiveProspect can enable the vendor's TrustedForm account to extend the claim period for any certificate claimed by the vendor account.

There are no changes required to the TrustedForm script and since the vendor is already claiming certificates for the leads they sell within the standard claim period, there are zero changes to the lead selling process to extend the claim period for these certificates.
