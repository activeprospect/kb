### Stop Certificate Recording Manually

ActiveProspect has released an update to the TrustedForm script to include a function that stops recording.

For anyone collecting web leads from within a [Single Page Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPA) this means you're now able to control precisely when the TrustedForm script stops recording end-user events without waiting for the page to unload.
