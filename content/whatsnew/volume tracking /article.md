### Volume Tracking

We are excited to announce that Volume Tracking is live for our enterprise customers! This long awaited feature enables you to track your current product usage against your contract allotments, so you know how much volume you’ve got left at any given time. Visibility into your platform volume will arm you with the knowledge to make better decisions about your lead flows. No more surprise overages!

When you begin using the dashboard and questions arise, we created [this help article](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4870822-volume-tracking) that explains how to use the new feature in detail. We’ve also built in the ability for you to ‘Contact your CSM’ directly from the dashboard - help is only a few clicks away.

This feature is for our enterprise customers only. If you want to learn more about upgrading your account, talk to our sales team sales@activeprospect.com today!
