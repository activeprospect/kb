### New Integration! Trestle: Phone Intelligence

From just a phone number input, this integration allows you to validate the metadata attributes associated with a phone, such as Is Valid, Country Code, Is Prepaid, Line Type, Carrier, and more.

This service will allow you to _Prioritize leads_ by filtering out noise in your lead queue, deprioritizing low-quality leads coming from undesirable line types or invalid and disconnected phone numbers; _Optimize workflows_ by routing leads correctly and with ease, getting leads to the right teams faster using metadata, like country calling code and carrier; and _Improve conversion_ by appending and validating contact records and leads for better conversion rates.

Check it out in our [community post](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4891382-trestle-phone-intelligence) and [integration catalog](https://activeprospect.com/integrations/trestle/phone_intelligence/) for more details!
