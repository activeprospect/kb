### LeadConduit: New rule to filter obscenities

The **is obscene** and **is not obscene** rules allow you to filter out leads that contain obscenities in certain fields.

You can use these rules with any _string_ field, including _first name_, _last name_, _city_, _email_, _state_, _street_, and _url_ in the **Acceptance Criteria** of your _Source_, **Conditions** within your _Field Mappings_, **Step Criteria**, and **Filters** within your Flow _Steps_.
