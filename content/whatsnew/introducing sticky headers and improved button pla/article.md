### Introducing sticky headers and improved button placement!

With sticky headers, tasks like saving a flow or adding a new step are available no matter how far down the screen you've scrolled. This makes key actions easier to find - and you more productive.

Wondering where a button went? Chances are we’ve moved it to the header in the top right of your screen. This way, there’s greater consistency (and less to think about) when you need to take an action within LeadConduit.
