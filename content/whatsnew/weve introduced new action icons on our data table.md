### We've introduced new action icons on our data tables.

Introducing data table action icons and improved consistency!

One of our goals is to communicate effectively with our users. This improvement aims to improve clarity and consistency throughout our data tables.

We've added new icons, improved column names, consistent column order, and added color and tooltips to icons.

You might notice a few views without these improvements. We're working on it!
