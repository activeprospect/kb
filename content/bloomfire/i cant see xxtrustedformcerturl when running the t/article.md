# I can't see xxTrustedFormCertUrl when running the TrustedForm javascript on my web site

xxTrustedFormCertUrl is the TrustedForm Certificate URL created on your web site when the TrustedForm script runs. But what if you can't see it added to the HTML/DOM?

xxTrustedFormCertUrl is the hidden field containing the TrustedForm Certificate URL created when the [TrustedForm javascript](https://app.trustedform.com/certificates/issue) runs on your web site. If you cannot see it being created in your site, you may want to use the callback function provided by ActiveProspect. This function returns its value.

For an example andÂ  more information, please see these articles:
