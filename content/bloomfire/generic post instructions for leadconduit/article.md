# Generic POST Instructions for LeadConduit

These are instructions for submitting leads into a LeadConduit flow using the default integration.

# Posting URL Format

LeadConduit posting URLs have a consistent format. Two parts of the URL vary:

`https://app.leadconduit.com/flows/{{FLOW ID}}/sources/{{SOURCE ID}}/submit`

- **Flow ID** — The 24-character flow ID generated by LeadConduit that uniquely identifies the flow receiving your lead.
- **Source ID** — The 24-character source ID generated by LeadConduit that identifies the source of the lead.

NOTE: The Flow and Source IDs are crucial to ensure the lead goes into the correct flow and is attributed to the correct source. The sample URL above will not work because it contains flow ID and source ID placeholders. The actual URL with real Flow and Source IDs must be obtained by the LeadConduit account holder for the appropriate Flow/Source combination.

# Request Method

LeadConduit supports receiving leads using a GET or POST request. We strongly recommend using POST.

## Request Headers

The two headers shown below are required when submitting leads using the POST method. The `Content-Type` header may be omitted for GET requests.

`Accept: application/json`

`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

You may also submit leads using the XML or JSON Content-Type if you use our standard format. Please contact support@activeprospect.com for more information.

## Supported Fields

Each flow contains a unique set of acceptable fields. These are specific to each flow and Source and are listed in the Source's submission docs.

## About Data Types

The supported fields table lists each field supported by LeadConduit. Each field has an associated type, which helps make sense of the data you provide.

If a field has a value that cannot be interpreted as the expected type, no error will be given unless the LeadConduit account holder has explicitly configured the flow to do so.

Nevertheless, your leads can make it through the system when the data provided in each field is comprehensible to LeadConduit.

| **Data Type** | **Description** | **Examples** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| string | Any string data which can include alphanumeric characters, whitespace, special characters, new lines, etc. | “John”<br>“I would like some information on your product”<br>“0123” |
| number | Any string which can be parsed to a number | “1000”<br>“9,998.99” |
| date, dob | Most strings which are reasonably recognizable as a date | “1995-12-25” (recommended)<br>“Dec 25, 1995”<br>“12/25/1995” |
| ssn | A US Social Security Number. Data submitted in this field transient. It is never stored or logged by LeadConduit. | “123-45-6789”<br>“123 45 6789”<br>“123456789” |
| postal code | A US, UK, or Canadian postal code | “78751”<br>“78751-4424”<br>“AA11A 1AA” |
| state | A US State abbreviation, or international locality | “TX”<br>“Quebec” |
| range | A numeric range, with a high and low boundary. A non-range is also acceptable provided is a number | “1 to 10”<br>“1-10”<br>“10+”<br>“10” |
| gender | Gender of the consumer | “Male”<br>“Female”<br>“Other”<br>“M”<br>“F”<br>“O” |
| phone | A US phone number in a common format (optional extension must be preceded by the x character). To specify the type of the phone number append “h” for home, “w” for work, or “m” for mobile to the number. | “1-512-789-1111”<br>“512-789-1111 x1234”<br>“(512) 789-1111h”<br>“5127891111m”<br>“(512) 789-1111w” |
| email | An email address | “foo@bar.com”<br>“foo+bar@baz.com” |

# Real-time feedback

When a lead is submitted, LeadConduit provides real-time feedback in the HTTP response body. This feedback identifies which one of three possible outcomes occurred. The outcome is derived from a series of actions and rule evaluations that take place while the lead is processed through the flow. The process of each flow is different because it is based on the individual needs of the LeadConduit account holder.

The possible outcomes are:

- **Success** — The lead was accepted by the buyer.
- **Failure** — The lead was not accepted by the buyer. The reason field explains why.
- **Error** — An unexpected problem occurred and lead handling was unable to proceed normally. The lead was not accepted. The reason field provides more detail.

Real-time feedback in the response always contains the 24 character LeadConduit lead identifier. If possible, capture this value in your system. It can be used to track down discrepancies or help troubleshoot problems.

# HTTP Response Codes

You can expect an HTTP 201 for every correctly handled lead submission.

It is possible that you may also receive an HTTP 502, 503, or 504 response if the system is under extremely high load. This is a transient condition, and you should retry sending the lead submission request again in a few seconds.

Any other status code in the 400 or 500 range should be reported to support@activeprospect.com. Please be sure to include the full HTTP request information (GET vs. POST, URL, and parameters being sent).

# Sample Lead Submissions

The examples in this section show lead submissions from the command line using the ubiquitous curl utility.

The below example shows the successful submission of a lead:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|  | curl -v -X POST |
|  | https://app.leadconduit.com/flows/5462c7eb76fefd217d333552/sources/5462c7fb745fb567baf2e093/submit \ |
|  | -H ‘Accept:application/json\` \ |
|  | -H \`Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded\` \ |
|  | -d \`first\_name=John&last\_name=Doe&phone\_1=(512)%20789-1111&email=jdoe%40test.com&mortgage.property.state=TX&mortgage.loan.purpose=purchase&mortgage.loan.amount=100000&mortgage.loan.down\_payment=20000&mortgage.property.use=primary&mortgage.property.type=single%20family&mortgage.property.postal\_code=78751’ |
|  |  |
|  | > HTTP/1.1 201 Created |
|  | > Connection: keep-alive |
|  | > Content-Length: 66 |
|  | > Content-Type: application/json |
|  | > Date: Wed, 12 Nov 2014 02:53:46 GMT |
|  | > |
|  | > { ""outcome"": ""success"", ""lead"": { ""id"": ""5462cdc5869bdb81148ece10"" }, ""price"": 0 } |

The below example shows the submission of a lead that failed because it was a duplicate:
