# Do I need to generate a different TrustedForm certificate for each lead buyer?

If you sell shared leads, then this can be a concern. The answer is, ""No, there should just be one certificate per lead."" If you are selling the lead 3 times, youâ€™ll pass the same certificate to 3 different buyers.
