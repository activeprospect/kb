# TrustedForm API Overview

```
The TrustedForm Certificate API is available to TrustedForm account holders based on the products they have purchased and been given access to. Generating certificates DOES NOTÂ require use of the Certificate API. Instead publishers who desire to create certified leads must use one of the SDKs available as part of the TrustedForm Certify product.

Every account with access to TrustedForm products is assigned to one of three TrustedForm API versions (two of them are being deprecated). You can find your TrustedForm API version at by viewing your settings page.

TrustedForm Certificate API documentation can be found at the following links:
4.0
3.0 - deprecated
2.0 - deprecated
```
