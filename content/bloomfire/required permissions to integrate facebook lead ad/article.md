# Required Permissions to Integrate Facebook Lead Ads with LeadConduit

The LeadConduit Facebook Ads Routed Inbound integration gives Facebook page owners control over which LeadConduit flows receive leads in real-time.

To connect a Facebook Lead Ads with LeadConduit, all permissions listed in the Business Integrations section under Settings on **your personal Facebook page** are required. For pages that are connected to a Meta Business, you will need to also **be connected to the business and have a role configured**, as well as approve LeadConduit’s access to the Business when the permissions are requested.

When connecting your Facebook account to LeadConduit for the first time, you will be prompted to grant LeadConduit all of these required permissions. The prompts will appear as below:
