# Transactional Billing

# LeadConduit

LeadConduit pricing is based on billable transactions. A transaction is an event between LeadConduit and an outside service, or any time a lead enters or leaves your account. Billable transactions are those in which an event occurs in one of our LeadConduit integrations.

Examples of a billable transaction include a lead submitted into your LeadConduit account from your website (a source event) or a lead being sent from your LeadConduit account to your CRM or ESP (a recipient event). For most lead flows, there are 2 billable transactions per lead.

We bill this way to accommodate the diverse set of use cases for which customers use LeadConduit. For leads that are submitted to your LeadConduit lead flow but are deemed non-qualified and are not delivered to your CRM or ESP, you are only charged for the single billable event of the lead entering your account. Transactional billing helps eliminate costs associated with bad leads that are rejected in real time.

# Integrations

Like other outbound transactions, integrations such as Email Oversight or DNC Scrub count as an outbound billable transaction. These services typically require an account with the provider and may result in additional fees paid outside of the ActiveProspect system.

# Add-ons

We contract with many third-party companies and resell their services in LeadConduit. We call these Marketplace Integrations. If you purchase validation or data enhancement services like BriteVerify, Telesign or TowerData through LeadConduit, you will simply pay the transaction cost for that product. There will not be a separate LeadConduit transaction charge.

# ActiveProspect Products

We do not bill for transactions between your LeadConduit account and other ActiveProspect products like SuppressionList or TrustedForm, which are priced separately. You simply pay for the usage of those services -- there are no billable LeadConduit transactions.

## TrustedForm

TrustedForm pricing is based on the number of certificates you retain/claim each month and the number of certificates stored in your account. Storage costs are tabulated and charged once a day.

## SuppressionList

SuppressionList pricing is based on the number of times SuppressionList is queried and the number of records stored across all of your lists. We do not charge per list nor per query URL, though the queries generated on those URLs are included in your cost. We tabulate the number of records stored and charge for those once a day.
