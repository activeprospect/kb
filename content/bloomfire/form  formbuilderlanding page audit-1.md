# Form / Formbuilder/Landing Page Audit

keywords: formbuilders, form builders, forms

Ever wondered which integration to use for your forms or landing pages? Look no further! We've done the hard work for you by making a list of compatible systems, noting which products they work with best, and adding any notes we thought might be helpful. If you're curious about an integration not listed here, please contact our Support team and we'd be happy to chat with you further.

DISCLAIMER: This audit is based off our investigation of these services. It is possible that these integrations have made updates since we last investigated them and could now be compatible. Please reach out directly to these companies to determine the latest status.

NOTE: LeadConduit is ""LC"" and TrustedForm is ""TF"".

| # Good for Both |
| [Unbounce](https://unbounce.com/) | Form-based landing pages | YES | YES | Easy JS section for TF,  fairly simple for LC. <br>[Implementing TrustedForm on Your Unbounce Page](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4788544-implementing-trustedform-on-your-unbounce-page) |
| [Formidable](https://formidableforms.com/) | Showcasing form results on your site | YES | YES | Works with TF.

| [123FormBuilder](https://www.123formbuilder.com/) | Gathering contacts with a template form | YES | YES | Works, may need the Platinum platform to do all this. [Implementing TrustedForm on 123FormBuilders](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5189112-implementing-trustedform-on-123formbuilders?_gl=1*yvtfuy*_ga*NjUzMTIyNjYwLjE2ODk3ODYwNTc.*_ga_QHXBV6N7D1*MTY5NzEzNDE2My45LjEuMTY5NzEzNjMxNS41MS4wLjA.) |
| [Short Stack](https://www.shortstack.com/) | Running contests & promo pages | YES | YES | Webhook integration works with LC. <br>Can add Code Widget for JS/TrustedForm, although you have to write some custom JavaScript to get the CERT URL value into the custom form e.g. hidden field name = form\[custom\_field\_1\]. To use [code widget](https://help.shortstackapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047082571-Code-Widget), you may need to upgrade your plan. |
| [LandBot](https://landbot.io/) | Chatbot styled forms & flow builder | YES | YES | LC setup is okay. Works with TF, may need to upgrade plan. [Implementing TrustedForm on Landbot](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5227400-implementing-trustedform-on-landbot) |
| [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/) | Advanced WordPress integration | YES | YES | Technically, yes, but could be costly and / or challenging.<br>[Implementing TrustedForm on WordPress with GravityForms](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/4383260-implementing-trustedform-on-wordpress-with-gravityforms) |
| [HubSpot Forms](https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/forms?__hstc=41051389.cfcab7cdc29c1c58c135a33720ea74f6.1748564220326.1748564220326.1748564220326.1&__hssc=41051389.1.1748564220326&__hsfp=3707738794) |  | YES | YES | This can technically work with TF but may requires a paid plan and access to HubSpot Operations which allows them to write custom code. They will need this in order to capture the cert URL. |
| [FormKeep](https://formkeep.com/) | Hand-coded forms | YES | YES | Not for the novice, but we like it. More of a data processing platform than a form builder. |
| [Instapage](https://instapage.com/) | Form-based landing pages | YES | YES | Works with both. [How to Install TrustedForm in an Instapage Landing Page](https://nicklenihan.com/how-to-install-trustedform-in-an-instapage-landing-page/) |
| [Landerlab](https://landerlab.io/) | Drag & drop no-code landing page builder | YES | YES | To include the TF Cert URL in your lead, create a hidden field and substitute your field label for the 'field' in the TrustedForm Certify SDK javascript snippet. |

| **Tool** | **Best For** | **LC** | **TF** | **NOTES** |
| # Good for One |
| [LeadsHook](https://www.leadshook.com/) | Create interactive experiences across customer journeys using decision trees. | ? | YES | Works with TF. [How to setup up TrustedForm with LeadsHook](https://www.leadshook.com/help/activeprospect-trustedform-script/) |
| [Elementor](https://elementor.com/) |  | ? | YES | Not sure, but some customers have had success with TF by pasting the SDK into the SEO section inside of the space allotted for Google's SEO tool. |
| [LeadCapture.io](https://leadcapture.io/)  (previously known as **GetLeadForms**) | Add a LeadForm to any website or landing page | NO | YES | As long as the TrustedForm Web Script is present on your landing page, GetLeadForms will automatically capture the TrustedForm Certificate URL with your delivered lead data.<br>[How to Setup ActiveProspect TrustedForm With Your LeadForm](https://getleadforms.com/blog/activeprospect-trustedform/) |
| [Gohighlevel](https://www.gohighlevel.com/) | Create custom forms | ? | YES | Works with TF. [Setting Up ActiveProspect Consent Tracking On A HighLevel Form](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001175529-setting-up-activeprospect-consent-tracking-on-a-highlevel-form) |
| [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) | A new take on forms | YES | NO | TypeForm currently does not support implementing the TrustedForm script. |
| Cognito Forms | Payments in free forms | YES | NO | We'd need an Integration for this to work EASILY with their Webhook. It can be used today with LC Inbound Field Mapping. |
| Zoho apps integration |  | YES | NO |  |
| [FormAssembly](http://formassembly.com/) |  | ? | YES | Works with TF and captures the appended hidden fields. To add the Certify javascript snippet follow this guide:<br>[Using JavaScript on a Form and Within Calculations](https://help.formassembly.com/help/custom-javascript) |
| [Wix](https://wix.com/) | Create custom forms for your website | YES | Maybe | Leads can automatically be send to LeadConduit via Zapier, as Wix Forms can only send an email to a person or send to a ""Submission Table"" which exists only within Wix. No automatic way to get leads out of Wix to LeadConduit found, other than the Zapier/Wix Automations setup which is working great: [https://zapier.com/apps/wix-automations/integrations](https://zapier.com/apps/wix-automations/integrations).<br>Earlier, it TF script could be added by following these instructions (require Wix premium and use a custom domain to be allowed to add custom code to your website): [https://support.wix.com/en/article/embedding-custom-code-to-your-site](https://support.wix.com/en/article/embedding-custom-code-to-your-site)<br>However, things may have changed recently as we have received reports of this not working with TF scripts. |

| **Tool** | **Best For** | **LC** | **TF** | **Notes** |
| # None / Unknown |
| GetResponse |  |  |  | Self contained and difficult to get information out of it. |
| Google Forms | Free forms built into Google Sheets | NO | NO | One could technically connect with Zapier but can be challenging. |
| Wufoo | Quickly creating reports | NO | NO | Looks like Wufoo supports Webhooks - [https://help.wufoo.com/articles/en\_US/kb/Webhooks](https://help.wufoo.com/articles/en_US/kb/Webhooks) |
| Airtable Forms | Saving form results to a database | NO | NO | One could technically connect with Zapier but can be challenging. |
| Formstack | Business-focused professional forms | NO | NO | - |
| Formsite | Encrypted text fields and linked forms | NO | NO | Works with LeadConduit; TrustedForm will require some code to the the field to populate correctly. This would be incredibly problematic to integrate with because the form field names come through like this in a string (separated here for easier reading): 2=HULK&<br>3=SMASH&<br>4=4203+Guadalupe+St&5=Suite+B&<br>6=Austin&<br>7=TX&<br>8=78751&<br>9=5125556677&<br>10=5125511359&<br>11=activeprospect.test@gmail.com&<br>12=18+-+20&<br>13=Yes&<br>14=Yes |
| Formbakery | Simple self-hosted forms | NO | NO | Seems like email only delivery |
| Ninja Forms | Another WordPress form editor | ? | ? | Likely similar to Gravity Forms. |
| WPForms | A simpler WordPress form app | ? | ? | Likely similar to Gravity Forms. |
| JotForm | Making forms fast without an account | NO | NO | Jotform doesn't work with embedding custom Javascript. |
| Paperform | Building landing page style forms | NO | NO | We'd need an Integration for this to work with their Webhook.<br>It lets you add the TF Certify Web SDK but there is no way to retrieve the certificate URL |
| SurveyMonkey | Creating surveys | NO | NO | No integration / Does not allow custom javascript to be executed |
| SurveyMethods | Creating surveys | NO | NO | No integration / Does not allow custom javascript to be executed |
|  |  |  |  |  |
| **Tool** | **Best For** | **LC** | **TF** | **Notes** |
| # Others |
| [form.io](http://form.io/) |  | YES |  | This is what one of our customers uses. Requires the Webhook form action, which is a Premium Action. The form is injected via JavaScript after page load, making it super tricky to work with this platform. |
| LeadQuizzes | Boosting conversion with quiz questions |  |  | Only connects to Zapier for integrations |
| Outgrow.co |  |  |  |  |
