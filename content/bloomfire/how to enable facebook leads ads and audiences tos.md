# How to enable Facebook Leads Ads and Audiences TOS?

In order to use Facebook Lead Ads and LeadsBridge, you need to accept:

1. The [Facebook Ads TOS](https://www.facebook.com/legal/self_service_ads_terms)
2. The [Lead Ads TOS](https://www.facebook.com/ads/leadgen/tos)

_Note that the TOS must be accepted at the Page level_

Facebook prohibits a specific action once the lead is collected, such as creating a username and password inside the Lead Ads form.

LeadsBridge offers you custom integration and solutions, but **we are not responsible for a potential ban or violation of Facebook Inc. TOS and policies**.

You are responsible for your own action, even if you create a custom integration through LeadsBridge.

LeadsBridge is free to terminate your account if you fail or ignore to comply with the Facebook TOS and policies.

## **Privacy Policy in your Lead Ad**

Facebook, moreover, requires you to have a clear Privacy Policy in your Lead Ads form. Please refer to your Ad account manager to get more information, or [visit this page](http://www.iubenda.com/blog/2015/11/20/privacy-policy-for-facebook-lead-adverts/) to generate a Lead Ads privacy policy (maintained by Iubenda).

If you are unsure about which Privacy policy is provided in your Lead Adverts, please call your Accountant or your Layer for further information.

## **Custom Audiences TOS**

In order to use Facebook Custom Audiences with LeadsBridge, you need to accept the following:

1. [The Facebook Custom Audiences Terms](https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms/customaudience)
2. [The Facebook Terms For Conversion Tracking, Custom Audiences From Your Website, and Custom Audiences From Your Mobile App](https://www.facebook.com/legal/technology_terms)

Moreover, while syncing your Custom List Custom Audiences with your CRM/ESP, you have to accept our [TOS](https://leadsbridge.com/tos/) and state that the data housed in your own CRM have been legally collected from reliable sources and that **you have permission to use them for marketing purposes**.

Importing data on Facebook without the express permission to use them may violate the law and result in the suspension of your Facebook advertising account and your  LeadsBridge account as well.

## How to accept Facebook Custom Audience TOS?

If you're experiencing an error while setting up Facebook Custom Audiences on your LeadsBridge account, it might be related to the Custom Audience Terms of Service (TOS), which need to be accepted on Facebook.

1. Go to the Facebook Ads Manager and select your Facebook Ad Account. Open the hamburger menu and go to the Audiences section. On the top of the screen, a blue bar will appear, asking you to accept the TOS for the Ad Account.
2. As an alternative, you can also click on the Accept TOS link that shows up in the error message on LeadsBridge **.** This will send you to a new page where you can accept the TOS.


**Please note** that the TOS should be accepted for every Facebook Ads account separately.
