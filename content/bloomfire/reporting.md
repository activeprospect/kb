# Sorting

You can sort the report by any column and toggle between ascending or descending order by clicking on the column header. For grouped reports, column sort operates on the primary index. Sub-group items are not sorted.

# Flow Links

Clicking on a flow name will take you to the flow’s main page.

Note that deleted flows are represented by the Flow ID strings (a lowercase alphanumeric string) rather than a “friendly name”. Clicking on the link for a deleted flow will result in an error.

# Events Tab Links

Clicking on numeric table item will take you to the Events tab, preconfigured with a query matching the report parameters for the clicked item.

# Data Persistence

Data older than your account’s data retention period are not included in any reports. See [your LeadConduit subscription’s settings](https://next.leadconduit.com/settings) for data retention information.
