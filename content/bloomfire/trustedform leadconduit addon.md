#### **What constitutes a ...**

| **Success** | **Failure** | ****Error**** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Used when the request was successfully processed and the certificate meets the criteria.<br>A successful outcome indicates that there were no issues with the data provided in the request, and the products were executed successfully. | When the request was successfully processed, but the certificate contained undesirable data specific to the operation performed.<br>A failure outcome can occur, for example, when the fingerprints do not match or verify operation did not find adequate evidence of express written consent.<br>In general, a failure outcome indicates that after checking the certificate, something was discovered that indicates it does not meet the user's needs. [Learn more](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5146237). | When there is an issue with the request, that prevents it from being processed.<br>An error outcome can occur for various reasons, such as an invalid request schema, invalid certificate ID, or an unexpected internal error.<br>In general, an error outcome indicates that the issue with the request is not related to the specific data in the request but rather an issue with the request itself. |
