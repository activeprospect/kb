# Does page scan work for TrustedForm Facebook Lead Ads certificates?

Yes. However, TrustedForm Facebook Lead Ads certificates only supports page scan of the [custom disclaimer text](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1550411888622740) and checkbox questions. This means it will not search for text on the entire page but only in the supported areas.
