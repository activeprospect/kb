# Adding Groupings to a Report in LeadConduit

1. Create a new report or edit an existing one.
2. Select the ‘Select Groupings’ header. The menu will expand if closed, and close if already expanded.
3. Select the ‘Add Grouping’ button and open the dropdown menu.
4. Select an option from the dropdown menu.
6. Group by flow, source, recipient, outcome, and/or any field in your flow.
7. Add another grouping or update your report to see the results by selecting the blue ‘Update Report’ button.
8. Groupings often create an additional layer of detail for your reporting table. If you didn’t notice a change, be on the lookout for blue directional arrows indicating that a row is expandable.
9. When satisfied with your groupings, click the ‘Save Changes’ button.
