# How do I know what data is being collected by the TrustedForm Certify Web SDK? Should I be concerned?

ActiveProspect is an independent technology provider that has been in business since 2004. A variety of Fortune 500 corporations trust us to process and store their data.

We designed the system so that we are completely transparent about the data that is being collected. The data collected is available in the Certificate. The certificate is available only to those that handle the lead data.

We’ve gone to great lengths to make sure publishers are comfortable with the service. In fact we completely rebuilt the application in 2011 for this reason. We hide the query string of all page URLs just in case they contain proprietary information such as search keywords. We provide [legal terms to publishers](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform-eula/) outlining exactly what the script does and doesn’t do.

You can test it yourself. After you implement the script on your page, you can capture the Certificates and not forward to your lead buyers. This will give you the opportunity to review what is being collected before making the decision that you want to pass the Certificates to your buyers. Furthermore, anyone can signup for a paid account. You can try it out and see exactly what your lead buyers see.
