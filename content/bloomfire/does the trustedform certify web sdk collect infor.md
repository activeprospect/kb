# Does the TrustedForm Certify Web SDK collect information about traffic sources?

No, TrustedForm does not secretly collect information about traffic sources. We are explicit about all the information that is collected by the script.

There is a lot of confusion about the collection of traffic source data because the first version of TrustedForm that was released in June 2010 collected referer URLs. We received a lot of push back from vendors about this. We agreed with the publisher feedback so with the next version of TrustedForm we stopped collecting referer URLs. We also started truncating the site URLs to hide and query string data that might reveal traffic sources to a lead buyer. In addition, we made all of the data collected by the script publicly available on the certificate to anyone that handles the lead data.
