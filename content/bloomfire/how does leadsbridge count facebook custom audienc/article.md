# How does LeadsBridge count Facebook Custom Audiences contacts?

To count the contacts collected via Facebook [Custom Audience](https://internal.activeprospect.com/groups/55523/posts/4969955-how-to-get-started-with-custom-audiences) Bridge in LeadsBridge, we sum all the contacts synced, removed, and deleted. Let’s see an example..

You have 8000 subscribers on your Autoresponder/CRM, and you sync all of them via Facebook Custom Audience Bridge

The following day you collect additional 1000 subscribers and 200 unsubscribed from your lists.

So the total number of contacts synced via LeadsBridge is 8000 + 1000 – 200 = 8800 contacts

LeadsBridge won’t sync unsubscribed or deleted leads.

### How many contacts can I sync with LeadsBridge?

The contacts allowed to be synced from your LeadsBridge account depend [on your subscribed plan](https://community.activeprospect.com/posts/5039672-how-do-i-choose-the-right-leadsbridge-plan-for-me).
