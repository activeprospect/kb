# Security Overview

#### SUMMARY

ActiveProspect has achieved **Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 Type II compliance** for our SaaS platform solutions. The SOC 2 Type II report is an independent and detailed audit review measuring the operating effectiveness of ActiveProspect’s internal controls around the AICPA’s trust services criteria for security and service availability of our platform solutions.

#### SYSTEM SECURITY

Our systems are located on a private, isolated network, with only customer-required services exposed to the public Internet. We patch our systems on an ongoing basis to defend against current exploits. Servers are monitored by an intrusion detection system, and defended from web attacks by a web application firewall. Regular third-party penetration testing and ongoing automated vulnerability testing are performed on our systems.

#### AVAILABILITY

#### DATA SECURITY

Keeping customer data safe is a top priority at ActiveProspect. We work hard to protect our customers from the latest threats. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Our API endpoints require at least TLS 1.2 and a secure cipher. Our systems reside in a SOC 2 compliant datacenter. Access is restricted to properly credentialed datacenter employees.

#### EMPLOYEE ACCESS

Our employees may occasionally need access to accounts for support or troubleshooting purposes. ActiveProspect employees have undergone background checks before being granted internal access to our systems. Access is granted using the principle of least privilege. All employees are required to use strong passwords, which are reset every 90 days, and MFA in order to gain access to our applications.

#### CREDIT CARD SECURITY

We do not store credit card information on our systems. When you enter a credit card number for payment, it is transmitted directly from your browser to our payment processor’s systems who store your data on their PCI compliant infrastructure.
