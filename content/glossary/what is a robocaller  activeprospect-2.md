# Robocaller

Robocallers are automated systems or entities that make phone calls. They can be used by legitimate businesses and organizations for legal communication, or by illegal operations for fraudulent purposes. The term “robocaller” generally refers to the automated system or software making the calls, rather than the human operators behind them.


As a result, recipients affected by unwanted robocalls can also take legal action against the callers.

Moreover, legitimate robocallers are not allowed to call numbers listed on the national Do Not Call Registry, which is a list of phone numbers whose owners do not want to receive sales calls. Businesses must obtain these lists before making robocalls and are not allowed to call the numbers on them.
