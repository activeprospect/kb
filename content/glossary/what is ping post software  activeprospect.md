# Ping Post Software

Ping Post software is an automated solution that allows for quick and efficient lead distribution. With the click of a button, the software sends out pings to multiple buyers, ensuring that leads are distributed in real time.

In a traditional system, buyers purchase leads from sellers who send them over one at a time. Ping Post software changes that. When a lead becomes available, the seller sends a ping to several buyers at the same time. The buyers place their bids. The seller’s ping-post platform gathers these bids, ranks them (usually by price or priority), and promptly delivers complete lead details to the winning buyers.

Comparison websites have been using the [Ping Post method](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/ping-post/) to distribute leads among top bidders for a while. **This strategy required multi-party consent** where consumers allowed any company mentioned on a specific marketing partner list to contact them. However, the new FCC guidelines that advocate for one-to-one consent deem **the traditional Ping Post mechanism insufficient.**

To comply with new regulations and ensure consumer choice, **ActiveProspect developed a new model called “** **[Ping Pick Post](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/ping-pick-post/)****“**. This updated system adds a crucial “Pick” stage to the traditional Ping Post process, which enables consumers to choose which companies they want to be contacted by. As a result, Ping Pick Post is an improved version of Ping Post software that better aligns with the FCC’s recent consumer protection standards.
