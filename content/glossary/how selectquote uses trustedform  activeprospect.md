# TrustedForm Allows SelectQuote to Monitor Marketing Partners & Ensure Compliance

![](https://activeprospect.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/SelectQuote_Stats.png)

SelectQuote is a leading insurance brokerage and health services company. Their mission is to remove barriers to shopping for insurance, introduce more transparency and choice, and take care of people at a price that fits their budget. They shop on behalf of their clients to help them improve their financial and physical health.

Because SelectQuote adopts the latest standards and best practices related to TCPA and Medicare marketing, they needed a tool to prove their compliance on a lead level in case any claims were made against the company. Additionally, they needed a solution that would enable them to validate that their marketing partners were using the approved web form.
