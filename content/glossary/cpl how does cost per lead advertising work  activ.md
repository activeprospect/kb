# Cost Per Lead (CPL) Advertising

Cost Per Lead Advertising (CPL) is a form of performance-based advertising where the Advertiser only pays for Leads generated by the advertising. CPL has a lower financial risk for the Advertiser, compared with CPM (Cost per Thousand impressions) and CPC (Cost Per Click) where the Advertiser still pays even though there may be no tangible results from their advertising dollars. There are two forms of Cost Per Lead Advertising: buying web traffic on a CPL basis (affiliate marketing) or buying Internet Leads on a CPL basis (aka [Hosted Lead Generation](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/hosted-lead-generation/)).
