# Lead buyer

## What is a lead buyer?

A lead buyer is a business or individual that buys leads from third-party lead providers. Many companies incorporate lead buying into their lead acquisition process as an alternative or addition to generating leads from their own marketing or sales campaigns.

In fact, for small businesses that are unable to generate leads organically, buying leads might be the best solution for accelerating sales.

## Potential risks of lead buying

There are some **risks associated with purchasing leads** online. Such risks include:

3. **Bots:** Automated online bots may submit false customer information, generating leads that were never legitimately submitted.
4. **Deceptive Advertising:** Certain leads are generated through advertisements that may mislead consumers into completing a form under the false impression that they are receiving something different.

## Lead buying best practices

In order to mitigate these risks, it’s advisable to follow several **best practices** when purchasing leads, including the following:

- Make sure you purchase high-quality leads by **choosing reputable lead sellers** in your business niche.
- Ask the seller to provide their lead generation methods, whether it’s organic search optimization, paid advertising campaigns, or social media advertising.
- Monitor and measure performance of purchased leads to ensure they align with your business goals. Communicate performance feedback to the lead sellers on a regular basis to address issues and optimize future lead performance.
