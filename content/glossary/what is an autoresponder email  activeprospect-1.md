# Autoresponder Email

An Autoresponder Email (aka Confirmation Email) is an email that is automatically sent to an Internet Lead immediately after they submit a form. It could take the form of a welcome message to a new email newsletter subscriber, or a thank you message to someone requesting information about a product or service.
