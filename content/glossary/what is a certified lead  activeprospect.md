# Certified Lead

Certified Leads are leads that come with a [TrustedForm](https://activeprospect.com/products/trustedform/) Certificate of Authenticity. The certificate provides critical information about the lead like when and where the user signed up, including the IP browser version, and even a video of the user signing up (VideoReplay).
