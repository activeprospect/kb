# Marketing Leads

Marketing leads have expressed an interest in learning more but aren’t necessarily ready to buy. A marketing lead could be a subscriber to your email newsletter or someone that downloads one of your white papers. An E-Commerce company might acquire marketing leads in the form of email subscribers with the goal that they will eventually make a purchase on the site. A Consumer Packaged Goods company might use marketing leads for a loyalty program to distribute special offers or samples to their customer base. Their marketing database provides a means to build and maintain a relationship with their customers – even though purchases are made through retailers/distributors.

Marketing leads are typically comprised of only a few data fields (name & email) and are cheaper to acquire than sales leads. A marketing lead might be generated via Facebook Lead Ads or a CPL ad placement on a registration path. A marketing lead might eventually turn into a sales lead, but that is not necessarily the goal.
