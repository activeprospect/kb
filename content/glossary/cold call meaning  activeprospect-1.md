# Cold calling meaning

Cold calling is the practice of reaching out to potential customers who have **not previously interacted with a sales representative**. This method, commonly associated with telemarketing, is a traditional and widely used marketing technique.

In contrast, **warm calling** involves contacting customers who have shown prior interest in the company or its products.
