The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent agency of the U.S. government tasked with overseeing and regulating interstate and international communications via different mediums such as radio, television, telephone, cable, and satellite.

Its responsibilities include formulating and enforcing communication policies and regulations, industry oversight, and promoting technological innovation.

- Lead buyers cannot rely on their lead sellers’ documentation of consent to call, but must keep their own documentation as proof of consent.
