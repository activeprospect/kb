# Take Rate


### **Is it better to have a high take rate?**

Yes. After all, the more attractive an offer is, the more consumers will want to sign up. A high take rate drives up the effective CPM for the publisher.


_Note: Take rate is also a commonly used term in the e-commerce industry, but it means something very different. In this context, it generally refers to fees charged by third-party sellers, service providers, and marketplaces for transactions._
