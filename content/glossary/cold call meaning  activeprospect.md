# Cold calling meaning

Cold calling is the practice of reaching out to potential customers who have **not previously interacted with a sales representative**. This method, commonly associated with telemarketing, is a traditional and widely used marketing technique.

In contrast, **warm calling** involves contacting customers who have shown prior interest in the company or its products.

In the United States, **cold calling via phone has declined** in recent years due to regulations from the [Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA)](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/tcpa/) and the [Federal Communications Commission (FCC)](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/what-does-fcc-mean/). These regulations prohibit telemarketers from contacting cell phone users without their [explicit consent](https://activeprospect.com/blog/express-written-consent/). Additionally, the establishment of a national [Do Not Call (DNC) registry](https://activeprospect.com/blog/do-not-call-rules/) allows consumers to opt out of receiving telemarketing calls.
