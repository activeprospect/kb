# Ping Post Software

Ping Post software is an automated solution that allows for quick and efficient lead distribution. With the click of a button, the software sends out pings to multiple buyers, ensuring that leads are distributed in real time.

In a traditional system, buyers purchase leads from sellers who send them over one at a time. Ping Post software changes that. When a lead becomes available, the seller sends a ping to several buyers at the same time. The buyers place their bids. The sellerâ€™s ping-post platform gathers these bids, ranks them (usually by price or priority), and promptly delivers complete lead details to the winning buyers.
