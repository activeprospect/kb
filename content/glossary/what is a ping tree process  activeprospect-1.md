# Ping Tree

A ping tree refers to a process of lead distribution using [Ping-post](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/ping-post/) delivery to efficiently distribute leads to multiple buyers with varying criteria for leads. In addition to different lead criteria, each buyer often has different price points and volume requirements. Each lead is typically sold multiple times – the number specified by the lead seller. The leads are distributed by pinging a “tree” of lead buyers to match the leads appropriately.
