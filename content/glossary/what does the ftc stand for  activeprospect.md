# FTC

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is an independent government agency that protects consumers and promotes fair competition in the marketplace.

The FTC engages in various activities related to consumer protection and antitrust law, such as:

- **Investigations:** The FTC monitors businesses or organizations involved in activities affecting commerce, with a few exceptions (banks, savings and loan institutions, federal credit unions, and more). They do this mostly by conducting investigations and handling complaints.
- **Enforcement actions:** After conducting an investigation, the Commission has the authority to take legal action, either through an administrative or judicial process, if it has reason to suspect that the law has been violated.

Regarding **Consumer Protection**, for instance, the FTCâ€™s Bureau of Consumer Protection investigates complaints against unfair business practices, such as scams and deceptive advertising, and enforces actions to prevent these abuses. This bureau also manages the U.S. National Do Not Call Registry.
- **Rulemaking:** The FTC administers several laws and regulations to protect consumers and ensure equitable business practices.

In total, the FTC oversees the enforcement and administration of over 70 laws to ensure consumer protection and competitive markets, including:

- Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR)
- Pay-Per-Call Rule
- Equal Credit Opportunity Act
