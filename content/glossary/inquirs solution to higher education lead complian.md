# Inquir’s Solution to Higher Education Lead Compliance

![](https://activeprospect.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Inquir_Stats-1.png)

Originally formed as a Higher Ed Growth business in 2007, Inquir’s main focus has expanded to providing action-based marketing and advertising campaigns that connect high-intent prospects with high-quality companies within higher education and beyond.

While Inquir’s internally-built systems continued to support education, the company needed an external solution that could be compliant with all leads generated from Facebook – an extremely popular customer acquisition channel for many industries.

While some platforms offered compliance solutions, Inquir struggled to find one that could offer both lead generation compliance and integration with Facebook Lead Ads.
