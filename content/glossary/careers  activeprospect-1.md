""ActiveProspect is always open to new ideas and ways of doing things. This makes it possible for anyone to be impactful and make real improvements throughout the company when you put in the work to make it happen. Everyone being engaged makes me feel like part of the team. Everyone is working passionately to help our business, customers and the industry as a whole. Seeing that shared drive and willingness to participate in all the efforts that go into reaching our goals really helps to create a bond whether we are in person or not. The opportunities that AP provides us to meet in person helps a lot too!""

Second, we are intentional about recognizing a wide range of events and holidays which means there is always something fun to prepare for. Third, the company sees us all as humans with lives outside of work and does a great job respecting our work/life balance.""

Everyone cares about each other as people, not just as colleagues, which makes working together so much more fun. We also have an amazing culture club which makes time for us to feel included and part of a team. They organize many awesome events that work wonders in making us feel united and close, even if we're hundreds of miles away from each other.""
