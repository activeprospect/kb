# Automated message

When using text messaging, an automated message refers to a message sent to one or multiple recipients **using an automated text messaging platform**. Whether the message content is created manually or generated automatically, it is considered an automated text message if it is sent through an autodialer platform.




2. **Opt-out:** Text messages should include a simple method for recipients to opt-out by providing a reply keyword (e.g., “STOP,” “opt-out”) to unsubscribe from the service.
3. **Identification:** Text messages must clearly indicate the sender’s identity or the business on whose behalf the message is being sent. This can be achieved by including the sender’s name, contact information, or a recognizable brand name.
4. **Frequency and content:** Text messages should not be sent excessively or in a manner that could be seen as harassing or abusive. In addition, the content of the messages must not be misleading or deceptive.
5. **Emergency messages:** The FCC grants exemptions for emergency messages, such as those related to public safety or health alerts. Although prior consent may not be required for these messages, recipients should still be given the option to opt-out if they choose to do so.
