# How to Make Every Call Count in Today’s Finance Market

It’s no secret that the mortgage industry is more competitive than ever. Closing a potential buyer while you have them on the phone is paramount because there’s no guarantee of a second chance to sell to them. So, in a market like this, how do you make every call count?

ActiveProspect, Balto, Insellerate, and McGlone Mortgage Group are teaming up to help you answer that question. In this webinar, we’ll discuss how to leverage the right messaging, tools, and coaching strategies to set your loan officers up for success.

**What we’ll cover in the webinar:**

- How to flip the script on loan officer messaging from “refi market” to “purchase market”
- How to use AI as a real-time coaching session for your loan officers while they still have the borrower on the phone
- How to leverage your vendors and their technology (instead of building your own in-house solution for something that already exists)
- How to talk about blended rate from a call center perspective
