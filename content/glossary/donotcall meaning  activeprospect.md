# DNC (Do-Not-Call)

The Do-Not-Call registry, established by the [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/what-does-the-ftc-stand-for/) in 2003, allows individuals to opt out of receiving telemarketing calls. This initiative addresses the frustration caused by incessant unsolicited calls, offering consumers control over their contact preferences.

## Do-Not-Call meaning for marketing

The Do-Not-Call registry was created to provide the following benefits:

1. **Safeguarding consumers:** By allowing individuals to block unwanted telemarketing calls, the registry upholds the importance of respecting personal time.
2. **Improving marketing precision:** Businesses can use the registry to focus their efforts solely on individuals who have expressed interest in receiving calls, thereby boosting marketing effectiveness.
3. **Enforcing regulatory compliance:** Telemarketers are required to consistently monitor the registry and refrain from contacting listed numbers to avoid facing significant penalties.

## How to stay compliant with DNC rules

In order to **stay compliant with** **DNC rules,** businesses should integrate best practices throughout their telemarketing operations. Here are some recommendations to consider:

1. **Maintain updated call lists:** Ensure that your call databases are regularly refreshed and cross-checked with the latest DNC registry entries.
2. **Train your workforce:** Educate your telemarketing team on the DNC regulations set forth by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the [Federal Communications Commission (FCC)](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/what-does-the-ftc-stand-for/), emphasizing the significance of compliance.
3. **Utilize consent validation tools:** Platforms such as [TrustedForm](https://activeprospect.com/trustedform/) can simplify the consent documentation process and furnish credible evidence when necessary.
4. **Honor opt-out requests:** Promptly acknowledge and respect requests to be added to a DNC list, refraining from contacting those numbers in the future.
