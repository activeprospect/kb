# Internet Lead Delivery

The method by which Internet lead data is transferred from a lead seller to a lead buyer (Advertiser) is referred to as Internet Lead Delivery. The most common methods of lead delivery are email and HTTP GET/POST.

Leads are delivered either in real-time (one at a time) or in set intervals (via batch files). In the past, Advertisers would typically receive an email with a batch file attachment containing the leads. However, because of the time sensitive nature of Internet leads, most Advertisers now want to receive leads in real-time.
