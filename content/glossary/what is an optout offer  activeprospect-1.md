# Opt-out

In online lead generation, an opt-out offer is one where the opt-in box is pre-checked. The consumer must uncheck the box to opt out if they donâ€™t want to be signed up for the offer. Opt-out also refers to a user choosing to unsubscribe to communications they have previously signed up to receive. In order to be CAN-SPAM compliant, all email solicitations require the ability for users to opt-out from communications from within each email.
