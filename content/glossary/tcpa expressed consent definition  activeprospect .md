# TCPA expressed consent



Expressed consent, as defined by the TCPA, is a signed, written agreement between the consumer and seller. This agreement explicitly states that **the consumer agrees to be contacted by the seller** and includes the specific telephone number to which the calls may be placed.



1. **Fines:** Violating the TCPA can result in significant fines from regulatory authorities such as the FCC. These fines can reach thousands of dollars per violation, making non-compliance a costly issue.
2. **Lawsuits:** Consumers have the right to take legal action against businesses that violate the TCPA. Lawsuits can result in substantial financial damages.
3. **Reputational Damage:** Not complying with the TCPA can damage a business’s reputation and undermine consumer trust. Adverse publicity, customer discontent, and missed business opportunities can affect the company’s long-term success and sustainability.
