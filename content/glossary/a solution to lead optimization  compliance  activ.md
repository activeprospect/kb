# A Solution to Lead Optimization & Compliance

Fortegra, like many insurance companies, was beginning to face the increasingly difficult issue of finding fresh, valid leads at the right price. The company was paying far too much for leads that were either completely uncontactable, or had already aged too far out of the window of opportunity to convert potential customers.

With stiff competition and increasing pressure to verify Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) compliance, Fortegra needed to make some big changes to convert more customers and avoid potential litigation.
