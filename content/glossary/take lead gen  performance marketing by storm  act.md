# Take Lead Gen & Performance Marketing by Storm: Tactics for Weathering a Recession

Although the U.S. is not officially in a recession, more and more economists predict we are headed for one in the next year (Vox). Lead generation companies are wondering how they can stand out among the competition and how consumers’ attitudes will change regarding their purchasing power.

Join ActiveProspect and Three Ships for a webinar to help you understand the impact of lead generation purchasing in a recession, the effects on all parties involved, and the importance of adaptability to maintain sustainability. As a digital marketing agency founded at the lowest point of the Great Recession in September 2009, Three Ships is the expert on weathering the storm of an economic downturn.

Here’s what you’ll learn:
