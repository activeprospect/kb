# FCC one-to-one consent rule


In todayâ€™s digital age, where consumers face a deluge of marketing messages, respecting their privacy and preferences as a business is crucial to creating a long-lasting, solid relationship with them.

Prioritizing consumer consent not only enhances legal compliance but also cultivates a culture of integrity and respect, leading to **stronger customer relationships and business success** in the long term.


- **Respect Do-Not-Call regulations:** Marketing Calls and texts cannot be made or sent to numbers listed in the DNC without prior express permission.
- **Keep records of consent:** Both lead generators or lead sellers and lead buyers must keep records of consent.
