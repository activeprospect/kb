# Lead seller

A lead seller, commonly referred to as a lead vendor, specializes in **generating or acquiring prospective customer leads** and subsequently selling them to businesses or individuals.

These leads are usually individuals or companies who have shown interest in a particular product or service and have shared their contact information for further follow-up.

## How do lead sellers work?

Lead sellers can operate in **various verticals**, such as insurance, financial services, or any other industry where there is a demand for potential customers. They categorize leads according to specific criteria, such as industry vertical, geographic location, and current financial situation, to enhance their appeal to prospective buyers.

Lead sellers can acquire leads through two main strategies:

- **Generating Leads:** This involves generating leads through various marketing strategies. Each business employs distinct strategies to generate leads, which may encompass methods such as organic search optimization, paid advertising campaigns, or social media advertising.
- **Buying Leads:** Lead sellers can also purchase leads from other sources to supplement their lead flow. This can include buying leads in real-time from other lead sellers.


## FCC requirements for lead sellers

When it comes to selling leads, the main **FCC requirements** to respect are the following:

3. **Restriction on sharing information:** Consumers must consent to get communications from each seller individually, instead of giving general consent for multiple entitiesâ€‹.

The recent FCC guidelines concerning lead sales greatly affect the approach to lead generation and marketing communications. Companies need to revise their consent acquisition processes, enhance transparency in their disclosures, and confirm that every lead has provided clear and informed consent.
