# TCPA violation

# What is a TCPA violation?


Essentially, this means that **the company is potentially violating TCPA regulations** by making unsolicited calls, sending unsolicited automated marketing text messages, or using robodialers to deliver numerous prerecorded messages.


## What can lead businesses to TCPA violations?

- **Neglecting Do-Not-Call list screenings:** The National Do-Not-Call (DNC) registry serves as a crucial tool for telemarketers. Failing to screen lead databases against this registry can lead to reaching out to individuals who have explicitly refused to receive unsolicited marketing communications.
- **Absence of internal compliance protocols:** In the absence of rigorous compliance measures, there is a heightened risk of oversight or negligence concerning TCPA obligations. Sales and Marketing departments may inadvertently overlook compliance standards, leading to inadequate audit mechanisms that expose businesses to potential TCPA violation allegations.
