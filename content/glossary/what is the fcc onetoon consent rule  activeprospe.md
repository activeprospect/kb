# FCC one-to-one consent rule

The [FCC](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/what-does-fcc-mean/) one-to-one consent rule under the [TCPA](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/tcpa/) (Telephone Customer Protection Act) mandates that **consumers must give explicit written consent** to individual sellers for receiving marketing messages when ATDS automated telephone dialing systems will be used for calling or texting. This rule, formally adopted on December 13, 2023, but **effective from January 27, 2025**, aims to curb unwanted and potentially fraudulent communications inundating consumers.

In today’s digital age, where consumers face a deluge of marketing messages, respecting their privacy and preferences as a business is crucial to creating a long-lasting, solid relationship with them.

Prioritizing consumer consent not only enhances legal compliance but also cultivates a culture of integrity and respect, leading to **stronger customer relationships and business success** in the long term.

**The main requirements for businesses** under the FCC’s [TCPA one-to-one consent](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/expressed-consent-definition/) rule are the following:

- **Obtain prior express written consent:** Each lead seller/lead generator or lead buyer must obtain and retain [prior express written consent](https://activeprospect.com/blog/express-written-consent/) from the customer that authorizes the individually identified companies at a time to contact them.
- **Provide a clear and conspicuous** [**disclosure**](https://activeprospect.com/blog/tcpa-consent/) **:** Businesses must inform the customer about the nature of the consent.
- **Respect Do-Not-Call regulations:** Marketing Calls and texts cannot be made or sent to numbers listed in the DNC without prior express permission.
- **Keep records of consent:** Both lead generators or lead sellers and lead buyers must keep records of consent.
