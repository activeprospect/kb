# Consent-based Marketing

Consent-based marketing is the practice of only reaching out to consumers who have explicitly given their written consent to be contacted. The goal is to make sure that only “active” potential customers, those who have actively expressed interest in hearing from you, become part of your sales process.

With this marketing approach, you also enjoy the added advantage of verifying whether the prospect meets your specific criteria before reaching out to them. Unlike other marketing channels, you only pay for the prospects that match your criteria.
