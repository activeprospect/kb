# TPMO in Medicare

In Medicare, **TPMOs are Third-Party Marketing Organizations** that help Medicare Supplement, Medicare Advantage (MA), and Medicare Part D plan administrators with marketing and outreach efforts for annual enrollment. TPMOs are made up of brokers, agents, and marketing firms that assist in promoting and enrolling people in plans.

These organizations **provide marketing expertise and direct assistance to recipients**, improving the spread of Medicare plan information and facilitating well-informed enrollment choices.

Medicare Advantage (MA) plans now enroll half of all Medicare beneficiaries. This has made TPMO operators crucial in helping beneficiaries choose and sign up for plans. However, some marketing practices in this area have raised concerns about potential misinformation.
