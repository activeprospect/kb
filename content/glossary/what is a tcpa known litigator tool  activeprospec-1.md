# TCPA known litigator tool

A TCPA litigator scrub is a helpful tool for brands. It helps them avoid contacting people involved in legal actions under the [Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA)](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/tcpa/). By using this scrub, a company can stop itself from **reaching out to those who have filed lawsuits** for alleged TCPA violations. This practice protects businesses from costly legal disputes and [potential fines](https://activeprospect.com/blog/tcpa-violations/).

## How do TCPA litigator scrubs work?

These TCPA known litigator tools work by comparing businesses’ leads and contacts against **TCPA litigator lists.** A TCPA litigator list is a special database that includes names, phone numbers, and other details of people or groups who often file TCPA lawsuits. This list is very useful for businesses, especially those in telemarketing or customer outreach. It helps them **find and avoid high-risk individuals** who are likely to take legal action over unwanted calls, messages, or other types of communication.

## Why brands should use TCPA known litigator tools

For brands, using a TCPA litigator scrub tool is a proactive way to **comply with** [**TCPA regulations**](https://activeprospect.com/tcpa-compliance/tcpa-compliance-requirements/) and avoid legal conflicts with litigants. By excluding individuals on a TCPA litigator list, your company can save valuable time and resources while minimizing the complexities that come with managing disputes and potential legal consequences.
