# Co-Registration Path


The path takes a user through a series of lead-generation offers that are presented as part of a registration process. The user may sign up for these additional offers, which are always optional.

For example, when registering for a website for new mothers, a new registrant might be taken through a registration path of relevant lead generation offers such as diapers, baby formula, etc.
