# Branded Lead

A branded lead is an exclusive lead where the consumer is filling out an Advertiserâ€™s branded form to specifically request contact from that Advertiser. For example, if a consumer fills out a form to get more information from ADT, that is branded. Alternatively, if the form is for a home security comparison site that will match the consumer with one of many home security companies, that is not a branded lead.
