# What does ""TCPA"" stand for?

""TCPA"" stands for the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), a piece of federal legislation that requires prior express written consent for texts or calls made to mobile phones using auto-dialers or pre-recorded messages.

## Ignorance isn't bliss.

Protect your company by learning about and following TCPA best practices.


# Why follow TCPA best practices?

If you're one of the thousands of companies that use telemarketing or telesales as part of your outbound lead generation strategy, you simply can't afford to get caught in a TCPA violation. Failing to meet TCPA compliance standards can cost you in both legal fees and your brand's reputation -- litigation is on the rise.

You see, TCPA violations represent easy money for people ranging from angry consumers to class action litigators. Multi-million dollar settlements are common. To make matters worse, suits can be filed for perceived violations up to 4 years after the date of contact.

_Is this a genuine lead or are you about to call a serial TCPA litigator?_

TCPA regulation has led to the rise of professional TCPA plaintiffs who rely on marketers settling rather than fighting the lawsuit -- often because the companies lack good documentation for consent. Check phone numbers against lists of known TCPA litigators before calling.

## FAQ


TCPA compliance refers to the practice of seeking consumers' prior express written consent before reaching out to them with offers about products and services.




Calling or texting a consumer without having acquired their prior express written consent to be contacted is a violation of the TCPA. Violating the TCPA can have serious financial consequences. You could face fines ranging from $500 to $1,500 per violation. Moreover, the TCPA comes with a four-year statute of limitations. This means that any presumed non-compliant call can be used against you in legal proceedings for up to four years after it was made. And that's not all! The TCPA even allows for class actions, which means that a single call could lead to a massive class involving millions of consumers who received similar calls.
