# Co-Registration

Co-Registration is a common type of [Hosted Lead Generation](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/hosted-lead-generation/ ""What is Hosted Lead Generation?""). Co-registration is the practice of allowing a consumer to opt-in for multiple offers while registering for one primary offer. For example, while signing up for a newsletter, a consumer might see a checkbox with a sign up for a related newsletter from another company. This checkbox is the opt-in for the co-registration. By checking that box, the consumer data will be transferred to both Advertisers presented on the form.

It is important that consumers must explicitly opt-in for the co-registration placement to ensure that they truly want to be contacted for the offer.
