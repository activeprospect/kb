# Zintex Remodeling Group Uses TrustedForm and LeadConduit to Enhance Leads

![](https://activeprospect.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Zintex_Stats.png)

Zintex Remodeling Group (Zintex) is a family-owned and operated business that was established in 2001. Throughout the years, they have offered a number of different home improvement products, such as roofing, windows, and solar.

In 2016, they became the exclusive Bath Planet dealer in Dallas-Fort Worth, and they have been entering additional territories across Texas since then. Due to the growth on the bathroom remodeling side, Zintex is now exclusively selling bathroom remodels across eight different markets. They have gone from a $10 million bathroom remodeler in 2020 to being on pace to do $35 million in 2022.

As they grew bigger as a company, Zintex realized they were becoming a bigger target for potential compliance lawsuits regarding consent to contact consumers. They also noticed they were wasting money on duplicate leads from lead aggregators.
