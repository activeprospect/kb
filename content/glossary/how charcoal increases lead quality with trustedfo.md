# Charcoal increases lead quality by identifying the best lead sources with TrustedForm Insights

![](https://activeprospect.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Artboard-1-6.png)

Charcoal is a lead management software that helps companies bring lead sources into one location, before the leads are purchased.

From there, Charcoal scrubs, filters, and qualifies these leads with proprietary and customizable filters, which helps prevent companies from purchasing non-viable leads.

Charcoal was wasting time and money purchasing leads that had expressed interest months prior. They had no way of validating the time of form submission and had to rely on the word of their partners.

Therefore, they needed a solution to ensure their agents were only receiving real-time leads with a high intent.
