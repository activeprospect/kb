# Qualified leads: Definition and main categories

A **qualified lead** is a potential customer who has been checked to see if they are suitable, high-quality, and ready to buy. These leads go through an evaluation process to find out how likely they are to become customers.

By **segmenting leads** based on their demographics and behavior, businesses can better organize and focus their efforts on leads that are more likely to make a purchase.

Qualified leads are **categorized into different types** for more targeted marketing and sales strategies. The most common types are **Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) and Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs)**.
