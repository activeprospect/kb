# Recent FCC TCPA compliance changes

**January 2024:**

- Both lead buyers and lead sellers are required to maintain documentation of consent to call. Buyers cannot rely on documentation held by the sellers.

**February 2024:**

- Companies must honor DNC and revocation-of-consent requests as soon as practicable, and within no more than 10 business days after receipt of the request.

**August 2024 (NPRM):**


**Notes:**


- In the TCPA, the use of the word “‘seller”’ is inconsistent with our definition (and the industry’s definition). We use “'seller”' to refer to the entity selling the lead; TCPA uses the word “'seller”' in reference to the entity calling the end prospect.
