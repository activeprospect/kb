# Online Lead Generation

Online Lead Generation refers to the practice of turning Internet traffic into an Internet Lead (where a user submits a form requesting contact) or an Inbound Call (where a user calls the Advertiser). Three common ways in which online advertising is purchased is CPM (Cost per Thousand impressions), CPC (Cost Per Click), and CPL (Cost Per Lead).
