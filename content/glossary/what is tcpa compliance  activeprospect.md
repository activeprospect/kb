# What is TCPA compliance?

[TCPA compliance](https://activeprospect.com/tcpa-compliance/) involves following the guidelines set forth in the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), which is an important regulation designed to protect consumers from unsolicited unwanted communications including calls, texts, and faxes. To comply with [TCPA](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/tcpa/) standards, **businesses must obtain explicit consent** from consumers prior to performing outreach and engaging in telemarketing activities. They also need to utilize do-not-call registry checks and adhere to restrictions on calling times to avoid hefty penalties.

[**Following TCPA regulations**](https://activeprospect.com/tcpa-compliance/tcpa-compliance-requirements/) is not just a legal requirement; it is also a valuable practice for building trust and maintaining a positive reputation with consumers. Complying with TCPA rules helps reduce legal risks, enhances customer relationships, and is essential for ethical and reliable business practices.

## Main TCPA compliance requirements

- **Get prior** [**express written consent**](https://activeprospect.com/blog/express-written-consent/) from individuals before initiating telemarketing calls or sending texts via an automatic telephone dialing system (ATDS) or prerecorded voice.
- **Validate numbers against the** [**National Do Not Call (DNC) registry**](https://activeprospect.com/blog/do-not-call-rules/), state DNC lists, and internal DNC records to avoid contacting individuals who have opted out of communications.
- **Restrict telemarketing calls to the hours of 8 AM to 9 PM** local time for the recipient, with possible additional restrictions based on state laws.
- **Include clear instructions on** [**opting out**](https://activeprospect.com/blog/tcpa-revocation-of-consent/) of future calls and messages in all communications.
- **Keep thorough records of obtained consent**, including the method, date, and content, to ensure compliance with regulations.

**Disclose your name**, the name of the individual or entity on whose behalf the call is made, and provide a contact telephone number or address during each call.
