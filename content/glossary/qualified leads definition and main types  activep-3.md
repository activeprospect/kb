# Qualified leads: Definition and main categories

A **qualified lead** is a potential customer who has been checked to see if they are suitable, high-quality, and ready to buy. These leads go through an evaluation process to find out how likely they are to become customers.

By **segmenting leads** based on their demographics and behavior, businesses can better organize and focus their efforts on leads that are more likely to make a purchase.

Qualified leads are **categorized into different types** for more targeted marketing and sales strategies. The most common types are **Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) and Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs)**.

## Marketing Qualified Leads: Definition

They are assessed based on factors such as their job role, company revenue, and industry type.

Additionally, the marketing team analyzes the interactions these leads have had online with the company’s website and campaigns (email marketing, paid ads, social media marketing, etc…).
