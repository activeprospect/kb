# Prove consent to call and dial with confidence

TrustedForm Retain helps you comply with TCPA regulations (which require documentation of prior express written consent) and retain the TrustedForm Certificate, so that if consent was obtained, **you can prove it**.

TrustedForm Retain includes a session replay and event log that shows every step of consumer interaction and makes it easy to find the exact moment consent was obtained.

This will help you to **shut down TCPA litigation** before it begins.


# See how TrustedForm works

With a TrustedForm Certificate included with every lead you buy, you will have confidence that each lead has documented proof of consent to be contacted.

So, before you contact new leads, make sure you put in place a system that helps you **verify and document consent for every lead you buy**. This will help you avoid unnecessary TCPA litigation.

Take a look for yourself at how TrustedForm works.
