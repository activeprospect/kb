# Call Center Lead

A Call Center Lead is a lead that was generated by first being pre-qualified by a call center. The typical process involves the company buying inexpensive opt-in leads and using a call center to contact them to verify their interest. The call center then sells the verified leads to lead buyers either as web leads or call transfers.
