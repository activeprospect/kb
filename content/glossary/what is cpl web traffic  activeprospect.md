# CPL Web traffic

CPL web traffic refers to web traffic that is purchased from affiliates on a cost per lead basis. The leads are collected on the Advertiser’s website or landing page. This is different from Hosted Lead Generation or CPL lead buying where the lead is collected on someone else’s website.
