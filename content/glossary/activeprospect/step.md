# Step

A discrete operation defined in order to perform an action in a flow. When a lead is processed by a step, an event is recorded for that lead.  A step can be one of two types:
- Filter Step: Uses rules to determine whether the lead's passage through the flow is to be immediately terminated and if so, sends a specific response to the source.
- Delivery (or Recipient) Step: Organizes, formats and sends selected lead data to a recipient web location, enhancement service or batch file, then parses and appends to the lead the response returned by the recipient.
