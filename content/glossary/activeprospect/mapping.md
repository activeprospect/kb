# Mapping

The assignment of a value to a flow field or to a parameter in an enhancement or delivery step and is dependent on if a ruleset is passed. Mapped values may include flow field contents, system field contents, appended data, or constants. Used after a lead is processed by an inbound integration and before a lead is processed by an outbound integration. Mapping is also the similar process of assigning values when creating rules.
