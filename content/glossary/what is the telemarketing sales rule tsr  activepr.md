# Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR)



2. **Telemarketing calls are limited** to reasonable hours, with no calls allowed before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. in order to ensure that consumersâ€™ personal time is respected.
3. **Telemarketers must provide important information** at the start of a call, such as their name, the company they work for, and the reason for the call. This transparency helps consumers make informed decisions about whether to continue the call.
5. The Telemarketing Sales Rule **prohibits telemarketers from making any deceptive statements** that could mislead consumers, including providing false information about the costs, nature, or purpose of the products and services being offered.
