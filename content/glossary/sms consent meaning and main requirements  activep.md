# SMS consent: Meaning and main requirements



## SMS consent meaning for Marketing vs. Informational messages

It’s important to highlight that the FCC’s TCPA rules distinguish between marketing and informational messages, including their respective consent requirements:

- **Marketing messages:** These are typically promotional messages that are intended to **advertise a product or a service for purchase**.

- **Informational messages:** Informational texts typically **convey information that is necessary or beneficial to the recipient**, rather than primarily promoting sales. Examples of these types of messages include appointment reminders, fraud alerts, and delivery notifications. **Informational messages fall under the Prior Express Invitation or Permission (PEIP)**. This type of TCPA consent allows businesses to legally contact consumers for both marketing and informational purposes via phone calls or text messages. PEIP specifically applies to calls or messages made using non-autodialed systems or prerecorded messages.


## SMS consent: Main requirements

Businesses must comply with TCPA regulations when obtaining consent for sending commercial text messages. The key requirements for SMS consent include:

3. **Opt-Out Option:** Businesses are required to provide an easy way for recipients to opt out of future SMS messages, usually by allowing them to respond with “STOP” or other similar keywords. **Instructions for opting out must be included in the initial SMS**, and any opt-out requests must be processed within 10 business days.
5. **Consent re-confirmation**: Obtaining new consent is necessary if businesses plan to send messages beyond the original scope.
6. **Non-Marketing Messages**: For non-marketing SMS, a prior express invitation or permission could be sufficient, which is less strict than prior express written consent.
