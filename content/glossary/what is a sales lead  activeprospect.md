# Sales Leads

Sales leads are meant to be contacted directly by a salesperson. They are leads that have requested contact by submitting your “Talk to Sales” form on your website or completing a quote request on a comparison site.

For example, when a mortgage lender buys a lead from LendingTree.com, that is a sales lead. That consumer has filled out a form to get mortgage quotes from multiple mortgage lenders. They are in the market to purchase your product now. Sales leads are typically comprised of more data fields (name, email, phone and address) and are more expensive to acquire than marketing leads.

While it is important to respond to all leads quickly, when dealing with sales leads every second counts. Companies that buy shared leads from comparison sites often try to call the consumer within seconds of form submission.
