# Robocall

The [Federal Communications Commission (FCC)](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/what-does-fcc-mean/) defines robocalls as automated calls made with an autodialer. They can also contain a message made with a pre-recorded or artificial voice. The purposes of making these calls may be several: They are often used for political campaigns, telemarketing, or sometimes fraudulent activities.

In many cases, robocalls can be considered bothersome or even illegal, particularly if they violate regulations such as the [Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA)](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/tcpa/).

However, some robocalls serve legitimate purposes, such as providing healthcare reminders, banking and travel alerts, and customer service notifications.

1. **Telemarketing:** As a cost-effective method to promote their services or offers by contacting potential customers.
2. **Customer service:** To provide customer service updates such as account balances and shipping notifications, helping businesses improve services, and reduce customer inquiries.
3. **Political campaigns:** Mostly to deliver pre-recorded messages to voters and share information about candidates, encourage participation in elections, and seek donations.
4. **Appointment reminders:** Healthcare businesses often use robocalls to remind patients of upcoming appointments.
5. **Emergency notifications:** Robocalls are often used by public safety agencies to distribute crucial information during emergencies.
6. **Debt collection:** Debt collectors can use automated calls to reach people regarding unpaid debts. However, they must adhere to regulations such as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).
