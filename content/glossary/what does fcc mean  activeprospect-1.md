# FCC

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is an independent agency of the U.S. government tasked with overseeing and regulating interstate and international communications via different mediums such as radio, television, telephone, cable, and satellite.

Its responsibilities include formulating and enforcing communication policies and regulations, industry oversight, and promoting technological innovation.

Notably, the FCC also has jurisdiction over the content of business-to-consumer text messages.

To enhance consumer protection, the FCC, in December 2023, adopted new measures that cover the following points:

- Lead buyers cannot rely on their lead sellersâ€™ documentation of consent to call, but must keep their own documentation as proof of consent.
