# Lead qualification

# Lead qualification definition

Lead qualification is the process of assessing and **classifying potential prospects** or leads who have shown interest in a specific product, service, or solution. The main goal of lead qualification is to evaluate the likelihood of a prospect becoming a paying customer. This process involves analyzing several factors, including the prospect’s needs, financial capabilities, decision-making authority, timeline, and alignment with the offering.

Without having a lead qualification process in place, companies risk wasting valuable resources, including time and money, on leads that are unlikely to make a purchase.

## Benefits of qualified leads

By qualifying leads, you can better understand their level of interest in your offerings, place them within the sales cycle, and determine whether to nurture them further. This strategy helps businesses **improve their lead quality** and increases the chances of successfully closing more deals.

There are **two main types of qualified leads**:

- [**Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs)**](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/mql-marketing-qualified-lead/) **:** These prospects have shown interest in the business’s products or services and have interacted with the [marketing team](https://activeprospect.com/blog/lead-management-automation-guide-marketers/) through specific campaigns (email marketing, paid ads, social media marketing, etc…).
- [**Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs)**](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/sql-sales-qualified-lead/) **:** These high-intended leads have been qualified as prospects by the [sales team](https://activeprospect.com/glossary/sales-leads/) after engaging with a sales representative.
