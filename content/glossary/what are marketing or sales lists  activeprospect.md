# Marketing or Sales Lists

Lists are collections of contacts that might be used for sales or marketing campaigns. In direct marketing, lists are typically sold as “leads” based on whether they meet the criteria of the Advertiser. Leads from lists have not requested to be contacted by the Advertiser, so they have not provided consent for contact. Internet leads, on the other hand, are generated by consumers who have requested to be contacted.
