# TCPA

# What does TCPA stand for?

TCPA stands for the “Telephone Consumer Protection Act.” This law, passed in 1991, regulates the use of automatic dialing systems for outbound telephone communications, voice, and fax messages to contact consumers in the United States.


The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) was intended to protect consumers from unwanted telemarketing calls and text messages.  It was later expanded in case law to restrict unsolicited SMS text messages to cell phones as well.


## What does TCPA mean for marketers?


Moreover, in order to maintain TCPA compliance, it’s crucial to meet several requirements, such as:

- **Restricted Time Frame**: Call residential landlines only between 8 a.m. and 9 p.m. in the recipient’s time zone (consider possible variations in time restrictions by state).
- **Robocalls**: Obtain express written consent for marketing robocalls to cell phones, while Informational robocalls to landlines require regular consent.
- **Identification**: Provide name, company name, and contact information when calling or texting customers.
