**BLOG BUZZ**


**Understanding Do-Not-Call rules**

Telemarketing regulations, including the Do-Not-Call (DNC) rules, have become stricter to protect consumers from unsolicited calls. Tools like TrustedForm can help businesses comply by documenting proper consent.



**Facebook business integrations**

Competition in advertising is fierce, and privacy updates make it harder to reach audiences. Facebook offers powerful ad tools. Integrating these tools can streamline data sharing and enhance advertising effectiveness.


**HEADS UP**

ðŸš¨ **TCPA class action filings explode**

The total number of TCPA cases filed in 2024 was 2,788, marking a 67% increase from 2023. More alarmingly, class actions now account for over 80% of these filings, making 2024 the year with the highest number of TCPA class actions in history. The trend continues into 2025, with January alone seeing 172 TCPA class actions, a 268% increase from the 64 filed in January 2024. This steep rise in TCPA litigation, especially class actions, is a significant cause for concern, as each lawsuit has the potential to devastate a company.
