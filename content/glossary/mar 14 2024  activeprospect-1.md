**HEADS UP**

üö® **TCPA filings are up 50% compared to 2023**

The latest figures show a significant surge in TCPA cases filed at the onset of 2024, registering an impressive 50% increase over January of the previous year. However, a mere 32% of these filings, precisely 64 cases, were class actions - a distinct decrease compared to the over 50% share in 2023. The count of TCPA class actions filed in January of this year parallels that of January 2023. This suggests that, although there's a noticeable uptick in total cases, the frequency of class actions remains unchanged - at least for the moment.
