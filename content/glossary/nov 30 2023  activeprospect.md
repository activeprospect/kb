**HEADS UP**

üö® **The lead generation industry might be turned upside down!**

With its¬†[new proposed ruling](https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-398661A1.pdf), The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has taken a decisive step to address the ""lead generator loophole"". This entails requiring consent to be obtained exclusively on behalf of one seller at a time.

What does this mean for our industry? The Czar Eric Troutman¬†[broke it down](https://tcpaworld.com/2023/11/27/deep-dive-examining-the-practical-impacts-of-the-fccs-new-tcpa-ruling-on-express-consent-and-lead-generation/)¬†like this:

1)¬†_It extends DNC protections to text messages (no big deal)._

2)¬†_It redefines prior express written consent to mean an agreement that ‚Äúauthorizes no more than one identified seller‚Äù to contact a consumer. Importantly the word ‚Äúseller‚Äù means the company providing goods or services to a consumer‚Äìnot a lead seller._

3) _It requires that calls must be ‚Äúlogically and topically associated with the interaction that prompted the consent‚Ä¶‚Äù_

Consumers can now say goodbye to unwanted calls from numerous sellers, however, this change may negatively impact thousands of small-business lead buyers. If finalized ‚Äì the FCC will vote on December 13 ‚Äì businesses will have just six months to adapt to these new requirements.
