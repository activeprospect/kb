# Warm calling definition

Warm calling is an outbound sales approach focused on engaging potential clients through productive phone conversations. These contacts have typically been prepared through **prior interactions**, which may occur via various channels such as company events, the website, or social media. Additionally, individuals who have previously worked with a specific sales representative are also considered warm contacts.

Unlike **cold calling**—which involves reaching out to prospects with no prior engagement—warm calling requires some level of **familiarity with the company**. Warm calls usually follow a marketing campaign, an email series, or interactions on the company’s website.

## Warm calling strategies for lead generation

**Lead generation strategies** that support warm calling can include email marketing, online advertisements, social media outreach, direct mail, and event participation.
