# First Flow Creation

Creating your first LeadConduit flow is an exciting milestone that transforms your account from setup to active lead processing. This comprehensive guide walks you through building a complete, functional flow that demonstrates core LeadConduit capabilities while establishing the foundation for more sophisticated lead management operations.

## Understanding Flows

### What Is a Flow?

A flow in LeadConduit is a complete lead processing workflow that defines how leads move from sources through validation, enhancement, routing, and delivery. Think of flows as automated pipelines that handle every aspect of lead lifecycle management according to your business rules and requirements.

**Key Flow Components:**
- **Sources**: Where leads enter your flow (web forms, APIs, integrations)
- **Steps**: Processing actions applied to leads (validation, enhancement, routing)
- **Recipients**: Where leads are delivered (CRMs, emails, APIs, partners)
- **Rules**: Business logic that controls flow behavior and decision-making

**Flow Benefits:**
- Automated lead processing without manual intervention
- Consistent application of business rules and quality standards
- Real-time routing and delivery based on dynamic conditions
- Comprehensive tracking and reporting for all lead activity

### Flow Design Principles

**Start Simple**: Begin with basic functionality that addresses your immediate needs, then gradually add sophisticated features as your understanding and requirements grow.

**Plan for Growth**: Design flows that can accommodate increasing volume, additional sources, and evolving business requirements without requiring complete reconstruction.

**Maintain Clarity**: Use clear naming conventions and logical organization that make flows easy to understand and modify for yourself and team members.

## Pre-Creation Planning

### Define Your Requirements

Before creating your flow, clearly define what you want to accomplish:

**Lead Source Identification:**
- Where will leads come from? (website forms, partner APIs, imported files)
- What data format will sources provide?
- How frequently will leads be submitted?
- What authentication or security requirements exist?

**Processing Requirements:**
- What validation rules need to be applied?
- What data enhancement or enrichment is needed?
- How should leads be scored or prioritized?
- What business rules govern lead acceptance?

**Delivery Specifications:**
- Where should qualified leads be delivered?
- What format do delivery destinations require?
- How quickly must leads be delivered?
- What happens to leads that don't qualify?

**Success Metrics:**
- How will you measure flow performance?
- What acceptance rates are acceptable?
- What delivery success rates are required?
- How will you track ROI and conversion rates?

## Step-by-Step Flow Creation

### Starting Your Flow

**Access Flow Creation:**
1. Log into your LeadConduit account
2. Navigate to the Flows section from the main menu
3. Click "Create New Flow" or similar option
4. Choose a descriptive name for your flow that reflects its purpose

**Naming Best Practices:**
- Use clear, descriptive names that indicate the flow's purpose
- Include relevant details like lead type, geographic focus, or business vertical
- Consider version numbers if you maintain multiple variants
- Examples: "Home_Insurance_National_v1", "Auto_Leads_California", "Contact_Form_Processing"

### Adding Your First Source

Sources represent the entry points where leads enter your flow. Your first source might be a website contact form, an API integration, or a partner connection.

**Source Configuration Steps:**
1. Click "Add Source" in your flow interface
2. Search for existing source types or create a custom source
3. Select "LeadConduit Standard" for most basic implementations
4. Choose "Other" as the source classification for testing flexibility
5. Provide a descriptive name that identifies the source clearly

**Source Types:**
- **Default Sources**: Pre-configured integrations with popular platforms
- **Standard Sources**: Configurable webhook endpoints for custom integrations
- **Account Sources**: Connections with other LeadConduit account holders
- **Custom Sources**: Specialized configurations for unique requirements

**Testing Your Source:**
After creating your source, LeadConduit generates submission instructions that show:
- The specific URL where leads should be posted
- Required and optional field formats
- Authentication requirements
- Example submissions in multiple formats (JSON, XML, form-encoded)

### Configuring Basic Validation

Validation ensures that incoming leads meet your quality standards before further processing.

**Essential Validation Rules:**
- **Required Fields**: Ensure critical information is present (name, email, phone)
- **Format Validation**: Verify email addresses, phone numbers, and postal codes
- **Length Constraints**: Check that fields contain appropriate amounts of data
- **Business Logic**: Apply specific requirements like age ranges or geographic restrictions

**Adding Validation Steps:**
1. Click "Add Step" in your flow
2. Select validation or criteria step types
3. Define your validation rules using the rule builder
4. Test rules with sample data to ensure they work correctly
5. Configure appropriate error messages for validation failures

**Validation Examples:**
```
Email is present and matches email format
Phone number is present and contains 10 digits
State is one of: CA, TX, FL, NY
Age is between 18 and 75
```

### Setting Up Lead Enhancement

Lead enhancement adds valuable information to your leads through third-party data services.

**Common Enhancement Options:**
- **Address Validation**: Standardize and complete address information
- **Phone Validation**: Verify phone numbers and identify line types
- **Email Validation**: Check email validity and identify role-based addresses
- **Demographic Data**: Append income estimates, lifestyle information, or other demographics

**Enhancement Configuration:**
1. Browse available enhancement services in LeadConduit
2. Select services that provide value for your specific use case
3. Configure field mappings for enhanced data
4. Set up fallback behavior for enhancement failures
5. Test enhancement with real data to verify results

### Creating Your First Recipient

Recipients define where qualified leads are delivered. Your first recipient might be a CRM system, email notification, or API endpoint.

**Recipient Setup Steps:**
1. Click "Add Recipient" in your flow
2. Choose the appropriate recipient type for your destination
3. Configure connection details (URLs, authentication, field mappings)
4. Set up any required data transformations
5. Test delivery to ensure successful lead transfer

**Common Recipient Types:**
- **HTTP/API Recipients**: Send leads to custom endpoints or third-party APIs
- **Email Recipients**: Deliver leads via email with formatted content
- **CRM Integrations**: Direct integration with popular CRM platforms
- **File Recipients**: Generate CSV or other file formats for batch processing

**Field Mapping Configuration:**
Map LeadConduit fields to the format required by your recipient:
- Map standard fields like name, email, phone to recipient equivalents
- Transform data formats as needed (date formats, phone number formatting)
- Add static values or calculated fields as required
- Handle optional fields and default values appropriately

### Implementing Basic Routing Logic

Routing logic determines which leads go to which recipients based on your business rules.

**Simple Routing Examples:**
- Send all qualified leads to a single CRM system
- Route leads by geographic region to different sales teams
- Deliver high-value leads to premium buyers and standard leads to regular channels
- Split leads between multiple recipients for load balancing

**Routing Configuration:**
1. Add criteria to recipient steps that define which leads they should receive
2. Use rules to evaluate lead characteristics and determine appropriate routing
3. Set up priority ordering if multiple recipients could handle the same lead
4. Configure fallback recipients for leads that don't match primary criteria

### Testing Your Flow

Thorough testing ensures your flow works correctly before processing real leads.

**Testing Methodology:**
1. **Create Test Leads**: Generate sample leads that represent typical submissions
2. **Submit Through Source**: Use the submission instructions to send test leads
3. **Verify Processing**: Confirm that leads move through validation and enhancement correctly
4. **Check Delivery**: Ensure leads are delivered to recipients in the expected format
5. **Review Reports**: Use LeadConduit reporting to verify all steps completed successfully

**Test Scenarios to Validate:**
- Leads that should pass all validation and be delivered successfully
- Leads that should fail validation for different reasons
- Leads with missing optional information
- Leads that trigger different routing paths
- High-volume scenarios to test performance
