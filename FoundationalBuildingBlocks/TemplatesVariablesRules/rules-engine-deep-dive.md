## Rule Structure and Components

### Fundamental Rule Pattern

**Three-Component Rule Architecture:**
Every rule in LeadConduit follows the same fundamental structure, providing consistency and predictability across all features.

```
Basic Rule Structure:
├── Left-Hand Value (LHV):
│   ├── Field References: Direct data field access
│   ├── Template Expressions: Dynamic value generation
│   ├── System Variables: Platform-provided data
│   ├── Calculated Values: Mathematical operations
│   └── Function Results: Processed data outcomes
├── Operator:
│   ├── Comparison Operators: Equality and inequality tests
│   ├── Pattern Operators: Text matching and validation
│   ├── List Operators: Collection membership tests
│   ├── Existence Operators: Null and blank detection
│   └── Specialized Operators: Domain-specific comparisons
└── Right-Hand Value (RHV):
    ├── Static Values: Fixed comparison targets
    ├── Template Expressions: Dynamic comparison values
    ├── Field References: Data-driven comparisons
    ├── List Values: Multiple comparison targets
    └── Calculated Values: Mathematical expressions
```

**Rule Example Analysis:**
```
Rule: lead.age >= 18
├── Left-Hand Value: lead.age (field reference)
├── Operator: >= (greater than or equal to)
└── Right-Hand Value: 18 (static numeric value)

Rule: lead.state == recipient.target_state
├── Left-Hand Value: lead.state (field reference)
├── Operator: == (equals)
└── Right-Hand Value: recipient.target_state (template reference)

Rule: lead.email.includes('@gmail.com')
├── Left-Hand Value: lead.email (field reference)
├── Operator: includes (contains operation)
└── Right-Hand Value: '@gmail.com' (static string value)
```

### Operator Categories and Functions

**Comparison Operators:**
```
Equality Operations:
├── is equal to (==): Exact value matching
├── is not equal to (!=): Value exclusion
├── is greater than (>): Numeric and date comparison
├── is less than (<): Numeric and date comparison
├── is greater than or equal to (>=): Inclusive numeric comparison
└── is less than or equal to (<=): Inclusive numeric comparison

Practical Examples:
├── lead.age == 25: Exact age match
├── lead.income > 50000: Income threshold
├── submission.timestamp >= '2024-01-01': Date range filtering
├── lead.credit_score <= 750: Maximum score limit
└── lead.experience_years != 0: Non-zero experience requirement
```

**Pattern and Text Operators:**
```
String Operations:
├── contains: Substring presence detection
├── does not contain: Substring absence verification
├── starts with: Prefix matching
├── ends with: Suffix matching
├── matches pattern: Regular expression evaluation
└── does not match pattern: Regular expression exclusion

Advanced Text Operations:
├── is obscene: Profanity detection for content filtering
├── is not obscene: Clean content verification

├── is not blank: Value presence verification
└── length equals: String length validation

Practical Examples:
├── lead.email.contains('@gmail.com'): Email provider filtering
├── lead.phone.matches('^\\d{10}$'): Phone format validation

```

**List and Collection Operators:**
```
Membership Operations:
├── is included in: Value presence in collection
├── is not included in: Value absence from collection
├── intersects with: Common elements detection
└── does not intersect with: Disjoint collection verification

List Management Patterns:
├── Single Value Lists: ['CA', 'NY', 'TX'] state filtering
├── Range Lists: [18, 19, 20, 21] age targeting
├── Dynamic Lists: recipient.target_states variable collections
└── Template-Generated Lists: lead.tags.split(',') parsing

Practical Examples:
├── lead.state.isIncludedIn(['CA', 'NY', 'FL']): Geographic targeting
├── lead.age.isIncludedIn(range(18, 65)): Age range qualification
├── lead.interests.intersectsWith(recipient.target_interests): Interest matching
