### Mapping File
Created `image_mappings.json` containing:
- Original URLs (preserved for reference)
- Local file paths
- Source documents
- Image context
- Sequential numbering

## Usage Recommendations

### For Documentation Writers
1. Reference local images instead of remote URLs to prevent expiration
2. Use the provided alt text for accessibility
3. Apply concept tags for better organization
4. Maintain the established naming conventions

### For Content Migration
1. Use the mapping file to update markdown files
2. Preserve the directory structure for organization
3. Consider creating thumbnails for large images
4. Implement lazy loading for performance

### For Search Optimization
1. Leverage concept tags for faceted search
2. Use alt text for image search functionality
3. Create image galleries by category
4. Build visual navigation aids
