## Directory Structure
Each markdown file has its own subdirectory in `/Users/alex/Dev/kb/media/images/` with a sanitized name based on the source file.

## Image Naming Convention
Images are named using the pattern: `[doc-name]-[number]-[description].[ext]`
- `doc-name`: Sanitized directory name
- `number`: Sequential number (01, 02, etc.)
- `description`: Derived from alt text or 'image' if no alt text
- `ext`: Original file extension or .png as default

## Excluded Image Types
The following types of images were automatically excluded:
- Tracking pixels (bat.bing.com)
- Analytics images (doubleclick.net, googleadservices)
- Chili Piper iframes
- JavaScript pseudo-URLs

## Mapping File Structure
The `image_mappings.json` file contains an array of objects with:
- `original_url`: The source URL of the image
- `local_path`: The local file path where the image was saved
- `source_document`: The markdown file name it came from
- `alt_text`: The alt text from the markdown (if any)
- `image_number`: Sequential number within that document

## Usage
To use these downloaded images:
1. Reference the `image_mappings.json` file to find the relationship between original URLs and local files
2. Update markdown files to point to local images instead of remote URLs
3. The mapping preserves the context of where each image came from

## Next Steps
The downloaded images can now be used to:
- Update markdown files to use local image references
- Create backups of content including images
- Process or optimize images locally
- Ensure content availability even if remote sources expire
